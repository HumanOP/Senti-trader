11p7kwk,Autohellas S.A. (ATH:OTOEL) Has A ROE Of 21%,"While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine Autohellas S.A. ([ATH:OTOEL](https://simplywall.st/stocks/gr/retail/ath-otoel/autohellas-shares)), by way of a worked example.

Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.

[View the latest analysis for Autohellas](https://simplywall.st/stocks/gr/retail/ath-otoel/autohellas-shares)

## How Is ROE Calculated?

**Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:**

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) √∑ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Autohellas is:

21% = ‚Ç¨78m √∑ ‚Ç¨371m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).

The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each ‚Ç¨1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made ‚Ç¨0.21 in profit.

## Does Autohellas Have A Good ROE?

By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Autohellas has an ROE that is roughly in line with the [Retail Distributors industry](https://simplywall.st/markets/gr/consumer-discretionary/retail-distributors) average (18%).

&#x200B;

[    ](https://preview.redd.it/x86tborl69na1.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=443e4c75c3537924eeee3f13497b3292a4df79d0)

That's neither particularly good, nor bad. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Autohellas you can see here at the [risks dashboard.](https://simplywall.st/stocks/gr/retail/ath-otoel/autohellas-shares)

## The Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity

Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.

## Autohellas' Debt And Its 21% ROE

Autohellas does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.39. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.

## Conclusion

Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In my books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.

But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this [report on analyst forecasts for the company](https://simplywall.st/stocks/gr/retail/ath-otoel/autohellas-shares/future).",6_zeros,0,1678602985.0

Regulators discussed the new special vehicle in conversations with banking executives and hope such a measure would reassure depositors and help contain any panic, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The new vehicle is part of the agency's contingency planning as panic spreads about the health of banks focused on the venture capital and startup communities, the report added.

The U.S. Federal Reserve declined to comment on the report, while FDIC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Fitch Affirms Charles Schwab at 'A'/'F1'; Outlook Stable
Fri 03 Feb, 2023 - 1:58 PM ET

Fitch Ratings - Chicago - 03 Feb 2023: Fitch Ratings has affirmed The Charles Schwab Corporation's (Schwab) Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A'/'F1', and its Viability Rating (VR) at 'a'. At the same time, Fitch has affirmed Charles Schwab Bank, SSB's (CSB) Long-Term and Short-Term IDRs at 'A+'/'F1' and its VR at 'a'. The Rating Outlooks are Stable.


KEY RATING DRIVERS
Business Profile Supports High Rating: The ratings affirmation reflects Schwab's strong franchise in the mass market retail investor space and within the asset/wealth management space, its strong operating performance, strong benchmark capital levels, and its solid funding and liquidity profile.


Ratings Constrained by Operational Risks, Market Risk: Over the near-to-medium term, Schwab's ratings are constrained by the idiosyncratic operational and reputational risks associated with the ongoing integration of Ameritrade. Management has indicated that cost saves and revenue synergies are in line with expectations to date. Longer term, Fitch believes the primary rating constraint is the high sensitivity of revenue and earnings to volatility in equity markets and interest rates.


Performance Benefitting from Higher Rates: Schwab's revenue and pre-tax income continued to climb throughout 2022, benefitting from higher short-term interest rates that drove a meaningful increase in spread revenue, continued organic growth of net new assets and strong client engagement. While these tailwinds have been modestly offset by weak stock market performance, which drives asset management/administration fees, Schwab has shown the ability to control expense levels, which has led to the firm consistently generating positive operating leverage.

Fitch expects rates to move even higher over the next year, which should further benefit Schwab's spread and profitability, but metrics are expected to remain consistent with the current rating.


Benchmark Capital Ratio Remains Strong: Schwab maintains solid benchmark capital levels, with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 21.2% at 3Q22. The firm's regulatory binding constraint is its Tier 1 Leverage ratio, which was estimated at 7.2% at 4Q22; up 100 bps from a year ago driven by strong earnings and a decline in assets given the movement of customer deposits from the balance sheet to higher rate products. During 3Q22, Schwab lowered its operating objective for its Tier 1 Leverage Ratio by 25 bps, to 6.50%-6.75%. Fitch considers these operating levels to be reasonable relative to the VR.

Tangible Capital Affected by Securities Mark-to-Market: While benchmark and regulatory capital levels remain strong, Fitch also notes that Schwab's tangible common equity (TCE) levels have been meaningfully and negatively affected by the impact of higher rates on the investment portfolio.

Schwab's TCE to tangible asset ratio was 1.1%% at 3Q22, well below rated peers. After quarter-end 3Q22, management moved $80 billion of available-for-sale securities to held-to-maturity (HTM) and indicated that the company would only be at risk of going to a negative TCE with a several hundred basis point instantaneous increase in medium-term rates from current levels. Fitch expects Schwab's TCE to improve from this relatively low level during 2023 as earnings support further tangible capital growth and longer-term rates moderate.


Funding and Liquidity Supportive of Rating: Fitch views Schwab's funding diversity and available liquidity as solid. While Schwab's deposit balances, which are the primary source of funding for its three bank subsidiaries, declined during 2022 primarily due to client cash sorting resulting from the rising interest rate environment, Fitch notes that the firm's overall deposit franchise remains relatively strong and near-term liquidity is sufficient to handle further deposit run-off that is expected as clients find alternatives to holding cash on Schwab's balance sheet.

At 3Q22, Schwab's liquidity coverage ratio was a robust 118% and it, along with its operating subsidiaries, had access to $95 billion of liquidity from the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Fed Discount Window, unsecured lines of credit with various external banks and an unsecured commercial paper program. Fitch expects Schwab to utilize these non-deposit funding sources throughout 2023 to manage deposit outflows as clients continue to make cash allocation decisions.

Short-Term Rating Driven by Funding and Liquidity Score: Schwab's short-term IDR of 'F1' reflects strong intrinsic capacity for timely payment of short-term financial commitments. While Schwab's VR of 'a' corresponds with an 'F1+' or 'F1' Short-Term IDR under Fitch's Global Bank criteria, the 'F1' short-term rating is assigned because Schwab's funding and liquidity score of 'a' is below the 'aa-' minimum threshold required for an 'F1+' short-term rating.


Stable Outlook Reflects Operating Performance, Capital Management: The Stable Rating Outlook reflects the expectation for stable to improving operating performance driven by higher rates, continued net new asset growth and synergies from the Ameritrade acquisition. Further, the Stable Rating Outlook assumes Schwab will continue to enjoy stable liquidity levels and maintain strong risk-based and leverage capitalization.


Holding Company VR Equalized with Operating Bank: CSB's and Schwab's VR are equalized, reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary failure and default probabilities. Further, while Schwab's common equity double leverage is expected to remain well above 120%, Fitch considers holding company liquidity to be strong, supporting the VR equalization. Bank holding companies are mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for their bank subsidiaries.


RATING SENSITIVITIES
Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:
Operational Issues Could Pressure Ratings: Schwab's ratings remain sensitive to a large operational or technological security loss specific to the firm that causes significant reputational damage. Operational and technological security losses are inherently difficult to predict and measure and do serve as an upwards rating constraint. As noted above, Fitch believes this risk is exacerbated in the near term with the integration of Ameritrade as it completes numerous platform conversions through 2023 and 2024, particularly if the market experiences a prolonged period of volatility.

Higher Credit or Market Risk Appetite May Lead to Downgrade: Should the company loosen underwriting standards within its core loan portfolio or take on more notable risk within its investment portfolio, such that it meaningfully increases the credit or interest rate risk profile of the balance sheet and ultimately affects operating performance, it would be viewed negatively from a ratings perspective.

Sensitive to Capital Management: A sustained decline in Schwab banks' Tier 1 leverage ratio below the 5% regulatory threshold for well-capitalized banks or reporting negative TCE could also drive negative rating momentum along with reporting an LCR below regulatory requirements, though Fitch believes this is a low likelihood event.

Holding Company Sensitive to Liquidity Management: Should Schwab's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate trouble accessing the capital markets, or should liquidity coverage, as measured by cash plus high-quality liquid securities fall below four quarters of required cash outlays, Fitch could notch down the holding company VR from that of CSB.


Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:
Stronger Revenue Diversity and Capital Management Could Lift Rating: Over the longer term, Schwab's VR and IDR could see upside of potentially one notch should it generate greater revenue stability and diversity through various market cycles, combined with sustained capital and liquidity levels above internal targets. To the extent Schwab is also able to effectively execute its acquisition of Ameritrade with minimal integration challenges and client attrition and meet or exceed its projected financial synergies, it could also result in positive ratings momentum. This would also be predicated on the firm maintaining a conservative stance in relation to credit risk.

Short-Term Rating: The Short-Term IDR is directly linked to the Long-Term IDR and would be expected to move in tandem. The Short-Term IDRs are also sensitive to Schwab's funding and liquidity factor score.


OTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: KEY RATING DRIVERS
Long-Term and Short-Term Senior Unsecured: In accordance with the Bank Rating Criteria, Fitch has equalized Schwab's long-term senior unsecured debt rating with its Long-Term IDR, which is also equalized with its VR. This is the case when Fitch observes or expects the sum of holding company senior debt and group junior debt (QJD) to clearly and sustainably exceed 10% of risk-weighted assets (RWA) for the group. At 3Q22, Fitch estimates Schwab's levels of holding company senior debt and group QJD to be over 20% of RWAs. Schwab's short-term senior unsecured rating maps to its 'F1' Short-Term IDR, which drives the rating on the firm's CP program.

Preferred Stock: Preferred stock issued by Schwab is notched down from the holding company rating in accordance with Fitch's assessment of the instrument's non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles. Schwab's preferred stock issuances are notched four notches from the IDR, which includes two notches for non-performance and two notches for loss absorbing capacity.

Long-Term and Short-Term Deposits: CSB's long-term deposits are rated one notch higher than its IDR because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default. CSB's short-term deposits are rated 'F1+' in accordance with Fitch's Bank Rating Criteria based on the bank's long-term deposit rating and Fitch's assessment of the firm's funding and liquidity profile.

Government Support Rating: Schwab has a GSR of 'ns'. In Fitch's view, the probability of government support is unlikely and IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.


OTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: RATING SENSITIVITIES
Long-Term and Short-Term Senior Unsecured: The senior unsecured debt rating is directly linked to Schwab's VR and Long-Term IDR and would be expected to move in tandem. Additionally, if Fitch were to observe or expect the sum of holding company senior debt and group junior debt (QJD) to clearly and sustainably trend below 10% of RWA for the group, the firm's Long-Term IDR and long-term senior unsecured rating could be downgraded.

Preferred Stock: The preferred stock ratings are directly linked to Schwab's VR and would be expected to move in tandem with any changes in Schwab's credit profile.

Long-Term and Short-Term Deposits: CSB's long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change in the entity's Long-Term and Short-Term IDRs as well as Fitch's view of its fundamental funding and liquidity profile.

Government Support Rating: Schwab's GSR would be sensitive to any change in Fitch's view of U.S. sovereign support, which Fitch views as unlikely.


SUBSIDIARIES & AFFILIATES: KEY RATING DRIVERS
Bank Subsidiary Rating Receives IDR Uplift: CSB's Long-Term IDR is notched up from the bank's VR. Under Fitch's Bank Rating Criteria, bank-level Long-Term IDRs receive uplift if the sum of holding company senior debt and group qualifying junior debt (QJD) is expected to be sustained above 10% of RWA for the group. Fitch expects that Schwab's QJD levels will remain above 10% over the long term.

CSB's 'F1' Short-Term IDR reflects strong intrinsic capacity for timely payment of short-term financial commitments. While the firm's 'a' VR also corresponds with an 'F1+' Short-Term IDR under Fitch's Global Bank criteria, the 'F1' short-term rating is assigned because its funding and liquidity score of 'a' is below the 'aa-' minimum threshold needed for an 'F1+' short-term rating.


SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES: RATING SENSITIVITIES
Bank Subsidiary Sensitivity: If Fitch were to observe or expect the sum of holding company senior debt and group junior debt (QJD) to clearly and sustainably trend below 10% of RWA for the group, CSB's Long-Term IDR could be downgraded and equalized with its VR.


VR ADJUSTMENTS
The Asset Quality score of 'a' has been assigned below the 'aa' category implied score due to the following adjustment reason: Concentrations (negative), Non-loan exposures (negative) and historical and future metric (negative).

The Earnings Profitability score of 'a+' has been assigned below the 'aa' category implied score due to the following adjustment reason: Revenue diversity (negative).

The Capitalization and Leverage score of 'a+' has been assigned below the 'aa' category implied score due to the following adjustment reason: Leverage and risk-weight calculation (negative).

The Funding and Liquidity score of 'a' has been assigned below the 'aa' category implied score due to the following adjustment reason: Non-deposit funding (negative) and deposit structure (negative).

11p1mai,SVB - Customers Will Be Made Whole According To Kleiner Perkins,"Kleiner Perkins team sent this to their portfolio an hour ago:

***
Hi everyone - as mentioned, we think the deposits on the balance sheet are very likely to see 100% recovery. One positive aspect of the SVB balance sheet is that such a high % of their assets were invested in government backed securities which should make for a faster liquidation and therefore ability to recover a large % of the deposits. These are far easier to value and liquidate than individual loans.
To summarize, there are about $165bn deposits on the balance sheet. We think the combination of cash, securities, and loan sales to generate cash will produce ~$180bn of cash. This should provide enough coverage for the deposits. A significant % of this, ~67%, should be able to be recovered fairly quickly (within the next week) such that the FDIC should be able to deliver a large % of existing deposits in the next week, and the remaining will come as they sell the loan portfolio.
To the extent helpful, the detail behind this is:
- Today, they have about $39bn of cash and pro forma cash from the recent sale of their AFS (available for sale) securities book.
- In addition, there is $91bn of HTM (held to maturity) securities. These are highly liquid government backed securities. The value of these securities if they were to be sold is $15bn lower - this is where the equity hole / value gap is, as these are securities they purchased in 2020-2021 when rates were lower and now are worth less because rates have moved higher. These should be easily sold next week. If we assume an incremental $5bn buffer on top of the $15bn it means they can generate proceeds of $71bn in cash.
- Between existing cash and the securities sale proceeds, they should be able to have $110bn of cash proceeds in the next week. This is 67% of the deposit liabilities.
- What is left is $74bn of loans. These will take longer to sell, but should generate ~$70bn of proceeds even with a buffer/discount assumed because of it being a forced sale. For context, the majority of these loans (70%) were in fund banking and private bank which historically are safe, low credit loss loans. We assumed a $5bn buffer to get to the $69bn which is likely conservative given the makeup of the loans, but given the forced sale think helps frame the range of outcomes.
- With the loan sale, this will generate a total of $179bn, or 108% of the $165bn deposit liability.‚Äù",Sexy_Kumquat,30,1678585041.0

__________

I did some digging around their Terms and conditions and found these things I found kind of interesting.

Taken from https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/pp-balance-tnc

Unless otherwise expressly stated, all references to ‚Äúfunds‚Äù in these terms and conditions mean money denominated in sovereign currency and **not** cryptocurrency or any other form of asset.

Any funds in your Balance Account represent unsecured claims against PayPal, unless you have a PayPal Debit Mastercard¬Æ (‚ÄúPayPal Debit Card‚Äù), have enrolled in Direct Deposit, or have bought or received cryptocurrency. 

In that case, **PayPal places the U.S. dollar funds held in your Balance Account in one or more Program Banks**, as explained below in the paragraphs regarding pass-through deposit insurance provided by the FDIC.



Your eligibility for FDIC pass-through insurance **only applies** to U.S. dollar funds held in your eligible Balance Account balance and placed by PayPal in a Program Bank on your behalf. 

It **does not** apply to funds held in any non-U.S. dollar currencies, nor does it apply to any amounts held in cryptocurrencies.


**Your U.S. dollar funds are placed at one or more banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) that we choose in our discretion** (‚ÄúProgram Banks‚Äù)

and are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance at those banks only if you have a PayPal Debit Card, have enrolled in Direct Deposit, or have bought or received cryptocurrency.

Any cryptocurrencies you hold in your account, non-U.S. dollar currencies, or funds you hold in a business account are **not eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance.**

.

(This is my favorite part coming up..)

.

if your Balance Account is not eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance, **PayPal combines your Balance Account balance with the balances of other Balance Account holders and invests those funds in liquid investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws.**

You will not receive any interest or other return on the funds held with PayPal. PayPal owns the interest or other earnings on these investments.
____

And in their Program banks section.

https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/program-banks-tnc

If you have or use one or more of the offerings described below, your eligible funds will be placed by PayPal, as your agent and custodian, in one or more of the following banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) that we choose in our discretion (‚ÄúProgram Banks‚Äù) where they are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance:

* The Bancorp Bank

* Goldman Sachs Bank USA

* Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.

Those funds are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance against bank failure up to applicable limits.

We may add or remove a Program Bank at any time and without notice.

**Important**

* PayPal is not a bank and does not itself take deposits.

* You will **not** receive any interest, credit, or other earnings on the funds in your PayPal Balance account or Venmo account.

* **FDIC insurance does not protect you against the failure of PayPal or Venmo.**

11ola2t,Stock traders eagerly awaiting Jim Cramer‚Äôs recommendations so they can do the exact opposite,"NEW YORK‚ÄîStock traders across the country are eagerly awaiting the latest recommendations from CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer, only to immediately do the exact opposite.

According to sources within the financial industry, traders have grown tired of Cramer‚Äôs hyperbolic predictions and erratic stock picks, and have instead turned to his advice as a surefire way to lose money.

‚ÄúI used to follow Jim‚Äôs picks religiously, but then I realized that whatever he recommended was usually a terrible idea,‚Äù said one anonymous trader. ‚ÄúNow, I just wait for him to announce his latest recommendation, and then I immediately short that stock. It‚Äôs like clockwork.‚Äù

Cramer, for his part, seems unfazed by the phenomenon. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôve made some bad calls in the past, sure,‚Äù he said in a recent interview. ‚ÄúBut my track record speaks for itself. I‚Äôm still one of the most respected voices in the industry.‚Äù

Despite Cramer‚Äôs confidence, however, the trend seems to be catching on. Traders across Wall Street are reportedly sharing tips on social media about how to profit from doing the opposite of Cramer‚Äôs picks, and some have even started to develop automated trading algorithms that scan his recommendations in real time.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of like a game now,‚Äù said another anonymous trader. ‚ÄúWe all know that whatever Cramer says, we should do the opposite. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs our own personal contrarian indicator.‚Äù

For now, it seems that the ‚ÄúCramer effect‚Äù is here to stay. While some analysts have suggested that traders will eventually tire of the trend and return to more traditional investment strategies, others believe that Cramer‚Äôs influence may have irreparably damaged his reputation in the eyes of the trading community.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if Jim will ever be able to shake this,‚Äù said one industry insider. ‚ÄúThe fact that traders are actively seeking out his recommendations just so they can do the opposite is a pretty damning indictment of his credibility.‚Äù

11oka9y,"Let me explain Cramer's ""JP Morgan is a fortress"" tweet","Let's get the obvious out of the way first: Cramer is a vehicle to subtly coordinate market actions without exposing too much manipulation risk. You know it, I know it, we all know it. Inverse Cramer works because being wrong on the overt advice helps hide the collusion.

So the trick is, what's he really saying?

JP Morgan and fortress. As some have already pointed out, ""what else is a fortress? A Citadel.""

So that's our starting point. Let's look at major news involving the two...

Citadel poaches Python developer from JP Morgan
https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2021/11/quant-jobs-at-citadel

>McGuire spent the past eighteen and a half years at JPMorgan, where he was most recently an executive director in quantitative research on the bank's Athena team. Athena is JPMorgan's risk and pricing engine, which is coded in Python. At Citadel, McGuire will be a quantitative software engineer, based in New York City.

>Recruiters say the big demand now is for quants who are Python experts - hedge funds like Citadel need Python developes to work on software that can back test trading strategies. 

So Citadel picks up this guy to backtest new trade strategies end of 2021. This year, in a month's time, will be the end of the Bull Run as the market slides into bear territory.

Who gets obliterated through 2022? Just about every IPO since 2020.

See, Citadel came to prominence over HFT and trade confirmation technology. They DEFINITELY do NOT take advantage of PFOF to front run customers through any trading apps.

Let's take a peek at one of those trading apps, just a random one
https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/23/03/g31306072/shareholder-alert-pomerantz-law-firm-investigates-claims-on-behalf-of-investors-of-robinhood-marke

Timely news....

So here's my belief. Citadel gets reamed on their trades early 2021 by retail surge. They have to bail out their own - Plotkin and such. They're pissed and want to make up their balance sheet and then some. They poach this guy to develop a more aggressive strategy, perhaps tapping deeper into contract premiums and ""hedging"" those contracts with traditional stocks - bought and sold - in no particular order, mind you - adhering to T+2.

I bet it works GREAT. Revenue pours in and Citadel makes something like 18 billion in profit through the very bearish 2022. Tons generated from retail-bought options on startups, and everything else, that fall flat through the year.

Oops, maybe a little too aggressive? They back off beginning of 2023, market downward pressure relaxes for a bit of a bump...except now every one in entities that invest heavily in start ups, many from Silicon Valley, are nuked. Those fronting the actual cash start pulling their money out.

There's also something about JP Morgan, Citadel, and automated Repo confirmation with MaketAxxess, but I'm a dummy.

So now Jimmy boy is bumping elbows across the CNBC airwaves and twitter-sphere. Yo dawg, check out JP Morgan and fortress things.

So currently we are obviously in a recession but I have noticed a pattern of consolidation downtrend recessions and then a bust. Now obviously there's decent odds we are on track for an 80-100 year black swan event of our roaring twenties followed by the great depression (decently plausible). That's theory 1. However, the dow jones currently has a growth curve that is pretty similar looking to an S curve. The Dow's 10-year growth line kind of lining up for an S curve-style recession and then growth again. That's my main idea but I may be insane or the next Michael Burry.

Also, the monthly chart looks no bueno like the great depression. There's also the long-term debt cycle to consider with the S-curve theory

These are the big sharks in the water and they are taking advantage of those who are struggling.

They recently defaulted on a bond, this seems bearish (it is for the economy), but not for BX. This is where the big money really starts to fuk around with everyone, liquidity is king and gets to negotiate when things start to break. This is complex multi-layer bond stuff that I don't feel like writing about but this Bloomberg video explains it best.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-02/blackstone-defaults-on-531-million-nordic-property-backed-cmbs#xj4y7vzkg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-02/blackstone-defaults-on-531-million-nordic-property-backed-cmbs#xj4y7vzkg)

Blackstone has kept 20% of their money liquid (about $190 Billion) with another 20B that has been liquidated about a week ago in Bumble, the London stock exchange, and other GBP assets waiting for this.

The big dogs are about to put pressure on those that are struggling and will come out the other side of any real turmoil fatter and more asset-heavy than they were before. They have specifically noted on the front page of the last 2 quarters the amount of liquidity they have right now. We are not talking about regional banks, we are talking about Trillions, not the billions, and GLOBAL.

These guys went public holding all real estate days before the GFC and came out the other side.

The government moves slowly, SVB needs liquidity fast for payroll and it looks like BX & Apollo are coming to the rescue over the weekend, they are going to be ruthless in a fire sale.

On a macro level, these cracks will also lead to a pause or at least a .25 hike.

The bottom line, what is bearish for the small fish is bullish for the whales, negotiations will be an extremely uphill battle for anyone that is struggling.

But stuff is just about to kick off and I am going to help explain what is happening and will be happening in the coming weeks and months.

From the start of this fed cycle, I have been wondering who has been eating losses. Basic financial equation 101 teaches you that the present value of an asset is a function of the discount rate applied to its future cf or coupon rate. When the 10/30 year went from 1.5-2.0% in 2019-2021 to 4-5% this year, this meant the market value of those bonds would have fallen by close to 20-25%.

For example TLT, which is the 30 year teasury ETF, has fallen by about 21% in the LTM.

Most people don't understand the bond market in the US is the largest in the world, dwarfing the stock market. It is about twice the size of the stockmarket and is the deepest and most liquid securities market in the world. Within this market, the deepest and most liquid part of the market is made up of US treasuries and mortgage backed agency MBS securities.

With the sudden spike up in rates over the last 12-16 months, the mark to market losses of the bond market is probably somewhere to the tune of 4-6 trillion. And I have always been wondering where that was going to show up and blow something up in the financial market. And the answer is in the banks.

Don't believe what they tell you, Silicon Valley Bank was a very conservative bank. Out of their \~200 billion in assets, very little (<0.5%) was venture debt lending. As you can see in their Q4 Balance Sheet, they had 15 billion in cash/cash like securities, about 120 billion investment securities and 70 billion in loans.

https://preview.redd.it/1txj1mjma1na1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5db030273760e55e735cbe23f59f7bdc234c4ba6

within that 120 billion investment securities, it is almost entirely treasuries and Agency MBS/CMO and CMBS with a touch of muni bonds. You can't build a more conservative book if you tried. As these are all effective government securities as the GSEs are still in conservatorship under the treasury. For years due to Basel III, US banks have been derisking and now most of their balance sheets consists of government or quasi government securites which have almost no default risks.

https://preview.redd.it/lsa5410ab1na1.png?width=1383&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=08f812017cc1f95d3bb9744f7d63a150d9af5980

Now looking at the loan book, you can see the bulk of it is in global fund banking and investor dependent. Global Fund banking is an extremely safe segment, it consists of largely funding or bridging loans to venture capitalist making transactions. So for example if a VC  wants to invest in company A, but they want to wait 2 months before drawing down from their LPs, they will go to SVB to get a credit line for this purpose. This is an extremely safe business model as Venture/PE Funding is contracted funding and there has been basically no defaults on these types of loans ever in history. Then you have private bank, which consisted of lending to rich people over collateralized through the value of their houses, which is also a pretty safe business model as their asset coverage typically exceeds 150% of the loan value.

Even the investor dependent segment is typically very safe book, as they will write loans as simply a bridge when a financing round for the company has already closed, but are still waiting a few months for the all the papers to be signed and the funds to be transfered.

So wtf is happening, this is a bank that is holding like 2/3 of its book in government papers and the rest in fairly safe lending. The speculative lending to early tech business represent <0.5% of the book.

The answer is the federal reserve, this guy

He basically fucked over the entire banking sector. Remember that 120 billion in agency backed papers  and treasuries in the investment securities section of SVB , well, most of that is HTM (Hold to Maturnity). Its a bank, get over it, a duration mismatch is expected. But the amplitute of the loss is proportional to the raise in rates due simply how bonds work. In the SVB book, the average maturity is around 6 years. Some simple math point to about a 10% loss in this investment book that hasn't been marked to market, representing about 12 billion in losses. This wiped out all the equity of the bank and some of the  value of the bonds.

Overall the Agency papers and treasuries can be sold over the course of the next couple of weeks and depositers will get about 60 cents on the dollar and the remainder will be sold over the next 12-48 months and I expect most depositers to get back close to 90 cents + on the dollar.

Well that's great, you might say. NO, IT IS NOT GREAT. BECAUSE SVB was not a bad bank, it was actually a pretty conservative bank. It also wouldn't be insolvent if it wasn't for the fed. What it did suffer from was a unique deposit base that was largely not FDIC insured. Since it was largely catering to start-up companies, most accounts went above the FDIC limit of 250k, as a result, this was simply a bank run similar to during the great depression. It doesn't matter how safe the bank was, if there is a run, you won't survive it. And the uniqueness of start-ups which are most often cash burning and therefore extremely senstivie to the lack of cash just meant they were more flighty depositers. Marry that to the game theory dynamics of the low cost of getting your money out first so you can meet payroll mean't that once it starts, you can't stop it.

Ok, you ask, what the hell does it all mean for the future. Well, here is the thing. If SVB is underwater, are all the banks are underwater?

Here are the assets of JPM, again, for the major banks, JPM has a 3.5 trillion balance sheet, and BOA has a 3 trillion balance sheet. JPM only lists out 641 billion of that 3.5 trillion as trading securities and thus and they reported a loss of \~50 billion or \~8%.

https://preview.redd.it/pskuutvch1na1.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b2440e41969af319d6b7c38f0ad887e9684533d7

This is a similar picture with BOA, which lists out trading securites of 300 billion, but there is another 2.7 billion in other assets, of which 1 trillion are longer dated treasuries and agency securities. If we mark to market those losses, there is another 80-100 billion in losses which are not being marked to market.

https://preview.redd.it/gwn7vmluk1na1.png?width=1775&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9aff904456f63c469680d9b96f45cf06327e4dae

Again, going back to the original thought, someone lost 4-6 trillion through the bond market from fed raising rates. Close to 2 trillion is lost through agency securities with the reminder from treasuries. Unironically, close to 15% of this is lost from the fed itself, due to its own balance sheet of treasuries and agency papers. It looks like around 30% of those agency security losses or about \~600 billion is through the commerical banks. I suspect probably another 300-400 billion though treasuries. So the banking sector has lost about 1 trillion in the past year, of which only maybe 100-200 billion has actually been marked-to-market down as losses.

Remember, the size of the losses in Subprime was only about \~100 billion. Now, every 50 bps increase by the fed results in close to that much in losses to the banking sector. So yes, Mr. Powell wil likely blow up the entire banking system.

https://preview.redd.it/rc3npwezm1na1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b129ee19c69c5e14ef3be6410b3c5da580c943c2

Edit 1: Alot of people are pointing out that the deposit base of other banks are signficantly different. Yes 100% agree, but the run on liquidity of a bank can come in two ways. One is on the deposit side (see great depression and SVB), the other way is through the intrabank funding market (alas 2008). I will write a part II in the coming days of the drying up of that source of liqudity.

Edit 2: Also a lot of people keep pointing to hedging and managing duration risk. This is BS as all the banks have this unrealized loss on their balance sheet, go look.Imagine God telling everyone he is going to destroy your house, now go and try to find insurance on your house for less than the cost of building a new house. And to the smart asses mentioning swaps. Go ahead and try to swap your house for a new house for anything less 0. Now think termites slowly destroying your house over the course of a year instead an earthquake, good luck being the person trying to hedge that.

Edit 3: on all the people saying the larger banks are so much smarter and know what they are doing. SVB had the most liquid portfolio of any bank out there. They had about 8% of their desposits in cash and about \~45% in GSE/treasuries which is the most liquid instrument out there and can be sold down in a weeks notice. None of the other/largest banks are even close to that. The larger banks have a much lower deposit base like \~25%-30% of their capital base and maybe 10-20% in equity and 50-60% are based in intrabank financing (hello 2008). The finiky parts of the larger bank's capital structure aren't deposits, most of these are FDIC insured (but still probably only half or so as the business accounts certaintly aren't), it is the intrabank financing part. You know, the stuff that blew up lehman and bear sterns. 

Also people don't seem grasp what a bank is and think they should be 100% in cash or something. You do understand banks make money from spreads. Signaling to investors you are taking depositer cash, and investing them in 3-month t-bills yielding 0.25% is a great way to tell them you don't actually have a business model and is a money losing startup like Wework or some shit.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%. (Stats as of 2023-02-28)",hardyrekshin,12,1678496788.0

11o5jer,How major US banks could be at risk of sweeping defaults,"
With the recent implosion of SVB (Silicon Valley Bank), it's important to start looking under the rug before all of the roaches start running all over the place. In a nutshell, we know a few things have happened:

1. Trillions of dollars were printed and we aren't going to escape the effects of it.
2. Interest rates are up enough to really start killing off borrowing demand, to the tune of 20% volume of mortgage starts versus one year ago.
3. US consumer credit debt is way up, and personal savings are way down.
4. Treasuries are paying 4.5%+ and mortgages are up near 7%. Companies with too large of a disparity between what they pay out in corporate bonds and what they receive from risk free interest will be especially in danger, much like SVB.
5. If you look here- [https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/default.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/default.htm) you'll find that all the major US commercial banks have about $2T in residual (assets minus liabilities), about a 10% margin over their liabilities. Assets=22T, Liabilities=20T.

All it takes to start forcing banks to sell assets is 2 trillion dollars in losses. That's it. SVB is imploding over a $15B loss and JP Morgan is rumored to have $47B in unrealized losses on their books. *EDIT: the big 4 banks are at $114B in losses as of this moment with some estimates showing $600B in total unrealized losses across the banking sector* It's not a loss til you sell, right? Consumer credit card debt alone has reached $1 trillion. Most people no longer have adjustable rate mortgages, so we can discount that one, but the commercial mortgage industry isn't so tidy. It was more or less forgotten when regulations were tightened post-2008.

The numbers as of March 1st 2023-

MBS (mortgage backed securities) makes up 2.7 Trillion dollars

Commercial real estate makes up 2.9T

Residential makes up 2.5T

These are just a few, the link above has all the data.

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS) shows that the credit card loan default rate has crept up to 2.25% as of Q4 2022.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/03/06/auto-loan-delinquencies-up-in-2022/11393399002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/03/06/auto-loan-delinquencies-up-in-2022/11393399002/) \---6% of all subprime auto loans are late on payments.

Oh, and let's not forget inflation is somewhere between 6-8% YoY, and real inflation is as high as 20% solely based on dollars printed and money devalued. AND the M2 money supply is shrinking at a rate synonymous with economic depressions. M2 has only decreased from $21.7T to $21.2T since Feb 2022, representing a $500B drop or 2.3%.

All of this is to say, for the banks to be squeezed to the tune of $2 trillion from all of the above factors isn't much. If you take away the drop in M2 money supply, you're at $1.5T. If you take away an additional 8% from their assets since Feb 2022 due to inflation, you're already in the red ($1.5T-1.76T= -.26T). Now, that might be an exaggeration or conflation of factors. But if you even start to get close to 5-8% default rates on commercial loans (which are going to be hit harder due to a drop in consumer spending)- you wipe out another $150 Billion to $232 Billion. Not to mention what happens if MBS counted as assets on the banks books start to get dumped (again). Technically, if MBS, commercial, and residential properties collectively lose 10-30% of their value, this whole thing starts to get really ugly. This can all get out of hand quickly, especially if there are people who try to pull all of their money out of the banks because as we know, fractional reserve banking means they probably don't have enough to assuage the fears of the public at large.....

Even if the banks don't fully go into the red due to defaults, if they start to get close there's a good chance they'll have to start selling assets and unwinding liabilities to maintain adequate reserves per federal regulation, or risk going down completely. And once that selling starts, you better buckle up because the more of those assets that hit the market from various commercial banks, the less those assets will be worth on the open market due to supply outweighing demand.

We will more than likely end up in a situation where the Fed raises rates, attempting to execute a 'soft landing' but once the dominoes start to fall, it's very difficult to stop rolling defaults. First, consumers default on credit card loans, then home loans and auto loans, then businesses default on loans and fail to pay their leases, REIT's start to get squeezed, banks are unable to recover a large chunk of loaned out money, and all of a sudden you have banks creeping up on default, requiring a bailout from big daddy warbucks, the government. Even assets sold to recuperate borrowed money will become worth less than the loan value itself if there is too much selling at once.

The ideal play here is to be cash heavy once the selling really starts. You could try to time the market and buy some puts, but you might also get royally screwed if the party keeps going for longer than expected. The issue that stocks will find themselves in is that treasuries at 4.5% look very attractive if you're expecting a down year, which as more banks start having problems, people may very well get spooked and sell off their equities to sit in cash or treasuries/money market funds.

I've moved to about 20% cash, piled some into FAZ to short the banks with leverage (not ideal due to decay, I know), and I'm piling up cash in the event that real estate becomes more attractive, because you'd be able to buy at a discount and refinance once this all cools down in 3-5 years as is historically typical. Ultimately I like my stronger stocks like AAPL, GOOG, etc. I've sold over half my NVDA stake after the recent run-up because well, 100% gains in a few months is a little much, don't you think?

The answer is know one knows for sure. I don‚Äôt know if going into a weekend right now is better or worse for this sort of situation. This has the potential to be the black swan event that puts SPY at not only a 52 week low but could easily cause a true market crash. However, if this is just a one off event and this gets ironed out quickly and in a timely fashion this actually could end up being okay. 

We are either watching before our eyes the start of the next market crash or we are watching yet again markets barely survive ‚Äúthe big one.‚Äù Only time will tell for sure‚Ä¶ 

Honestly at this point unless that‚Äôs your round house or you are directly effect in a work setting the best thing anyone can do is continue to preserve capital and continue to make smart financial decisions. We despite what happens here are still likely to have an extremely bumpy 2023 and probably 2024. Remember the FED hasn‚Äôt even pivoted yet and generally post pivot is when the actual bottom is put in‚Ä¶ so this could continue to be a rogue year or two. 

Also just because we saw some probably once in a life time 1million % gainers on SVIB the last few days does not mean that is the normal. Do not go chasing these types of crash winners‚Ä¶ Even myself today let my winners run more than I usually do and I did it in a slightly more carefree way due to the environment. We 100% can prosper from this situation but stay humble and most importantly stay smart!

**CPI**

Next week is CPI‚Ä¶ why does that matter? Well this is going to be probably one of the most important CPI readings we have had in a very long time.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7xigkz7iqzma1.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=20eccf3af518e28ad1be5dea8ba353b8832ddf4c

Now what actually is somewhat impressive and reassuring here is that the chances for a 50bps hike has now gone from almost 80% before the 830am data to now 38% chances here at market close. 

CPI is going to be extremely important as it is the last major data that we will get (we do get PPI the next day) before FOMC on the 22nd. IF we get a good CPI reading then there is a very good chance that markets are going to fully price in a 25bps hike (there could depending on this bank situation even be a case for 0bps crazy enough). However, IF CPI comes in hot (a true rebound) then we are going to go to 100% chance 50bps and with his already scare market because of the bank situation we are going to see a repeat of June CPI if not worse‚Ä¶ 

My thoughts are this‚Ä¶ if CPI is good this is going to take a lot of fear out of the market not only for inflation but for rate hikes. Not only that but these market algos are looking for any reason to rally us. 

With the VIX nearly breaking 30 today and SPY now back in the 380s this is set up for a massive move one way or the other. My thoughts are here that if this banking situation is calmed by Tuesday and we get a good CPI we are going to see a pretty incredible rally into FOMC on the 22nd. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Currently SPY is at 188million volume this would make today the highest volume day on SPY since February 24th which was 214 million total volume. Interesting enough that was a major bounce point‚Ä¶

Taking a look at the daily supply/ demand chart here we have that newly established 405.17 supply (resistance). We are pretty much set up here (and this will likely depend on the bank issue/ CPI) for an even bigger breakdown to the 373.98/ 376.67 demand (support) from November/ December or we are set up to establish a new demand (support) potential on that 383.8 supply and make a pretty impressive push back to 388.52 and 394.68 demands (previous support now turned into resistance). 

We fell just short of 383.82 supply (support), however, there is a chance on Monday we could very well go down and touch that level. 

**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Honestly looking at the weekly S/D chart here it seems fairly obvious now that since really November we have just been chopping in this broad 382.2 to 412.5 channel. We are now coming in once again on this 382.2 demand (support). 

The fear here for bulls would be either this bank situation or CPI breaks us not only under 382.2 but closes us under it. IF that were to happen there is a very good chance depending on what FOMC would bring the following week that we could see a very impressive sell off down to 357.3. That 382.2 demand (support) is going to be a major level to watch. 

However, if we were to have a bullish week next week there is a very big chance that we could establish a higher demand (support) above that 382.2 level which would be bullish and I would 100% without a doubt start looking for a bigger recovery and push back to the 400s. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

https://preview.redd.it/nofdbynjqzma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e1d64cf4b79fb0940a41c5a0591de31f7834dae4

Taking a look at the spy daily here you can see we are in a pretty obvious massive blue falling wedge here. With this finally closing a candle below 390.1 the natural assumption would be for this to continue to breakdown to that 378 channel support. At this point we have gone from the November 395 to 405 consolidation channel to now attempting to break back down into the December 375 to 385 consolidation channel. 

SPY has officially fallen 5.7% or about $24 dollars in 4 trading days and has falling 4.3% or about $17 in the last two trading days. 

This much like that massive $12 breakout we had last week is overdue for a correction back to the upside. Now the caveat here versus that rally is that this is data/ news driven and this could turn into a bigger continuation. This was not a rogue fed speaker mentioning something to cause a rally. This is a really big deal. 

My thoughts here is that going into CPI Tuesday (granted this depends on nothing new happening with the banks over the weekend) that Monday is going to be a consolidation day. WE are very likely to see a smaller range type of day. We could easily attempt to recover back to the 390 area or we could attempt to get back down to the 380 area before EOD. I would not expect this extent of sell off to continue on Monday. However, if we continue to see sell offs like this into next week then that‚Äôs when we know this isn‚Äôt going to be just a one of bank and the true panic will set in‚Ä¶ 

Bulls ultimate target will be to retrace 390 and breakout back to 400/405 on a good CPI.

Bears ultimate target is to break under key 378 support and make a run for the 360s with a hot CPI reading.

The bulls biggest concern here is that we have officially lost the key pivot point of 390.1 With the bears finally closing under this support level that is very worrisome for anyone who wishes to go long here‚Ä¶ I will say that 390.1 is probably for the last 10 months been the most important single price level on SPY. 

Something I have talked about before but since May of 2022 until present day SPY has spent an extreme amount of time trading in the 375 to 407 range on the weekly. Of the last 44 weeks of trading‚Ä¶ all but 5 weeks has had price action that has taken place between 375 and 407‚Ä¶ that means that 88.6% of the last 44 weeks has at some point traded within the same $32 range‚Ä¶ 

Of the last 44 weeks all but 13 weeks have CLOSED within that same $32 range‚Ä¶ that means of the last 44 weeks of trading 70.5% of the time the market has closed within the same $32 range. 

I think much like I said back in 2022 this is where the majority of our trading for 2023 and possibly 2024 will take place. 

The issue we face here is that we have to ask the question‚Ä¶ are we more likely to see 375 or 407 again? There is obviously a case to be made for both. IF you are a bear here is your perfect opportunity to take a 30-60dte put and look for 375 if not the 360s. However, if you are generally bullish now is your time for 30-60dte calls and I would look for a retest of 407.

Bulls ultimately want to see a close over minimally 396.3 next week and bears ultimately want a close under 375.6. 

SPY Weekly Levels:

Support- 382.2 -> 375.7 -> 367.9  
 Resistance- 390.1 -> 396.3 -> 403.2

Supply- 383.82 -> 405.17

NOTE- this is going to be frustrating for the new week or two while the contracts roll on futures‚Ä¶ on tradingview they already rolled, however, TOS did not roll. I will try and talk old and new contracts to avoid confusion. In general S/D will be off old contracts and price action will be new contracts. 

Today we early morning looking like we were going to attempt to hold the 3920 demand (support) and turn that into a double bottom. However as you can see that did not work out too well for the bulls. 

We after establishing that 4055 supply (resistance) have really not looked back. We were able to break through 3960 and now 3920 demand (supports). These levels will now become resistance if we attempt to breakout next week. 

On a down side here we only have 3833 demand (support) established. If we were to lose that level and not immediately establish a new demand (support) then we do not really have anything holding us up until we get to that 3683 demand (support). 

However, if the bulls can quickly establish a new demand or reconfirm 3833 demand (support) Monday and we get a good CPI on Tuesday then I would look for a breakout to the 3960 to 4055 area.

Now what is most impressive here on the futures weekly (remember old contract) is that we are actually attempting to close exactly on 3864 demand (support). That actually could end up much like when we bounced and closed two weeks ago on 3971 demand (support) which led to a really nice double bottom. However, this time it then immediately led to a double top and established a new supply (resistance) at 4055. 

With the bulls holding over this key level that dates back to the December lows we have found ourselves at a high potential bounce point. However, if we were to lose 3865 next week I would start looking for that previous 3600 demand (support).

Now keep in mind here contracts rolled on ES for tradingview last night so these candles are going to be a little off and you will see that levels are off‚Ä¶ these will over the next week normalize and basically once we establish a new low and a new high it all fixes itself‚Ä¶

However, what you see is this bigger and broader red bear channel and we have a falling blue wedge being established within that. 

We did lose 3920 pivot point and now that would open up a breakdown to previous 3810 support. However, if the bulls can quickly take back 3920 next week this could look for a recovery back to the 4000-4050 area. 

Again so much depends on not only the banks but on CPI next week. I actually wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a very large either red or green week next week at all.

I have talked about this before but the JPM collar‚Ä¶ I mentioned on week 7 that historically that is the top or bottom and from week 7 to week 11 we see a reversion to mean‚Ä¶ which actually is playing out beyond perfectly right now. 

IF that pattern pays out we very well could start the next move up next week. As you can see here though with losing that key 3920 pivot point we now find ourselves staring down 3860 support. That will be a major level to watch.

Bears ultimate target will be a closure under 3860 support which opens up a breakdown to 3770 support. However, bulls ultimate target will be a closure minimally back over 3975. That would open up the potential for a move back to 4000s.

The VIX had an incredible day. I do not know the last time I have seen the VIX swing in price action the way it did today.. Amazingly the VIX still did not break through 30 today‚Ä¶ however it did reach its highest level since October 25th. AT that time SPY was trading from 378 to 385 so that is actually pretty on par for the course. 

Now the question is based on VIX here is are markets risk off or risk on? IS there fear or is there not fear? 

We actually have reached the extreme fear level of 24 today for the first time since October 13th. You what is incredibly magical about October 13th? Well that was the 52 week low on SPY‚Ä¶ that was the day that led to an incredible bounce from the 340s to the 420s. 

When I look at this I honestly think to myself that with extreme fear already set in and the VIX already elevated that unless this unwinds in an incredible way Monday that CPI is once again setting us up for one heck of a green rally. 

IF that CPI (which so far looks like it will per my estimates) puts in a lower YoY and MoM (shows that CPI is still dropping) then there is a really good chance that this market is going to put in an incredibly green day. I don‚Äôt know if will be as wild as Novembers 5.5% green day but I think we could easily see a 3-4% green day‚Ä¶ 

**DXY**

It was very clear today that the trust in the dollar fell which makes sense to see it drop like it did today. However, by EOD it did recover almost all of is losses. TO me that shows the strength in the dollar and I think that paints a bigger picture of this being a one off event as of now‚Ä¶ 

With DXY also breaking its rising wedge this further goes with my expectations of a massive green week next week. 

**10YR YIELD**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9r672uinqzma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=828900419b08e1c69bbb1cc333e33f751b27317a

Yields as a whole today had a massive drop across the boards. Now granted I am still 100% a rookie when it comes to yields and I am learning here so correct me if I am wrong here guys! 

But with this massive drop in rates today on the 10yr (and really market wide) while SPY sold off that shows that money is running to the safe haven of the yields. Money is 100% scared right now and the broader market is scared that this could be the next major financial crisis. 

This here also sets us up (SPY) for a massive green week next week. Why well when the yields sell off the way they have here (meaning money came out of market/ risk) when CPI comes in cooler next week and the chances of a 50bps go to 0% and we even start talking about a 0bps hike we are going to see all of this scared money flow right back into the markets. That is going to cause an incredible rally next week. 

This rally is support by the way DXY is moving also.

Today was probably my single best day I have had in 6-9months (not including lottos). This is my first perfect day (100% win rate) since February 22nd. 

Honestly today with the incredibly high volume and volatility actually felt like trading in a bull market again. All we had to do was be patient and wait for our play. Yes there was some rouge candles (mostly EOD) but almost everything from a technical stand point played out perfectly. Why is that? Well because there was BIG money in this today‚Ä¶ when big money and big volume come in they are all trading by computers/ algos.

What have I said since the beginning? My job as a trader is to figure out what those algos are going to do next and capitalize on it. Of course we never look to get the full move and we know we are only getting the bread crumbs from the bigger piece of the pie‚Ä¶ but today we absolutely killed it. 

Honestly today reminded me (which I haven‚Äôt felt in a long time) about how fun and easy it is trading during a bull market. I have preached for this whole bear market that the number one goal is capital preservation so that when we finally see the next bull market (and really just not a market with low volume/ easily manipulated by large orders) that we can fully reap the reward. 

I told myself (as hard as it was) last week that I would not do any more swings this week. I strictly day traded and despite being 100% correct on every swing I would have taken this week‚Ä¶ I am extremely happy with this week and I am extremely happy going into the weekend! 

I hope you guys all have a great weekend!",DaddyDersch,104,1678488542.0
11o2v86,Janet Yellen's Complete Testimony to the Senate on Joe Biden's Game-Changing Budget Proposal,"**Main Point**: The FED can only raise rates and urged congress to do something, Janet Yellen agrees they need to slow down the economy. Their is no bull market, they are going to force a recession.

[this is how I did my DD, it's not my opinion, this is all factual summary of the testimony](https://reddit.com/link/11o2v86/video/ixrcp7s4kzma1/player)

**TL; DR:**

The article covers various economic topics including Medicare solvency, taxes, IRS data transparency, debt, labor market, and inflation. Treasury Secretary Yellen emphasizes the importance of addressing the tax gap, promoting clean energy, and improving infrastructure. The Inflation Reduction Act and increased funding for the IRS aim to support American businesses and ensure fair taxation. While concerns about government spending and inflation persist, there is a need to invest in infrastructure and support households during difficult economic times. **The chairman suggests slowing down the economy to bring down inflation and questions whether to continue raising interest rates for a second year**.

**The Entire Summary of What Actually Happened & What Was Said (*****it was a 3 hour testimony*****)**

Yellen corrected a mistake about the net investment income and stated that extending Medicare solvency is a priority. The budget proposal calls for $4.7 trillion in new taxes, including a small business surtax and an increase in the death tax.

The Ways and Means Committee is looking for signs of a strong labor market and putting Americans back to work. The child tax credit was expanded in the American Rescue Plan to help low-income families hit hard by the pandemic.

ProPublica obtained a trove of IRS data, raising concerns about tax compliance and transparency. The overall debt is $31 trillion, with small businesses being hit hard, especially those with 50 employees or less.

The article covers various topics such as Medicare, audit rates on high-income partnerships, clean and renewable energy, disaster relief, mental health, inflation, Social Security, taxes, bank losses, and the IRS. Secretary of State John Kerry expresses concern about the suffering of the American people, particularly those who depend on Social Security as their major source of income in retirement.

Treasury Secretary Yellen monitors recent developments that concern a few banks and expresses disappointment in the administration's budget proposal, which fails to address the real challenges faced by Americans. The article also mentions a Stanford University report that found black taxpayers are disproportionately audited by the IRS, and the new IRS commissioner promises to report on this issue.

The discussion revolves around various economic policies and proposals presented by different individuals, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, raising corporate tax rates, supply chain problems, the President's budget proposal, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Semiconductor in Chips Act, and the Infrastructure Act.

Some individuals express concerns about deficits, borrowing, inflation, and dependence on other countries, while others emphasize the need to invest in America, create jobs, address issues, and strengthen supply chains. Secretary Yellen also refutes some points made by her colleagues and highlights the importance of closing the tax gap, promoting electric vehicles, and improving infrastructure and digital access.

The witness claimed that inflation would be temporary and brief, but a year later in June 2022, inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1. Dealing with inflation is the number one hardship for many Americans. The committee discussed ways to strengthen economic relations with Taiwan, including negotiating an income tax agreement to reduce double taxation on US and Taiwanese businesses.

The American people need to know that China may not play by the rules, and if necessary, we will tax the income of Chinese companies operating in the United States. The Inflation Reduction Act passed without a single Republican vote and put $80 billion into the IRS to improve its functions. The IRS has answered 90% of its phone calls, squashed its backlog of overdue returns, and introduced new online taxpayer tools.

The number of audits for taxpayers making less than $400,000 may rise if the size of that population goes up. Screening and document matching for those taxpayers will be increased. The administration is seeking to redefine free trade agreements and include tax parity for Indian Health Services scholarships. The budget does not raise taxes on households or small businesses earning less than $400,000 and pays for initiatives by remedying unfairness.

The adoption tax credit faced such a high audit rate and what steps have been taken to address this issue. Additionally, it is important to clarify that the taxes proposed in the president's budget are targeted towards high-income individuals and corporations, not small businesses or individuals earning less than $400,000.

The increase in IRS funding is aimed at improving their ability to serve Americans and ensure that everyone pays their fair share of taxes. The Inflation Reduction Act and Treasury's plan to incentivize domestic manufacturing of solar panels are efforts to support American businesses and reduce reliance on foreign imports. While there may be concerns about the impact of government spending on inflation, it is important to consider the benefits of investing in infrastructure and supporting American households during difficult economic times.

The article discusses the US government's debt limit and the recent inflation rates. The Treasury Secretary delayed announcing the debt limit until January 13th due to massive spending packages.

President Biden was not informed by the White House during negotiations. In May 2021, the chairman believed the inflation was temporary and interest rates would remain low. However, in October 2021, he stated that monthly inflation rates would return to levels close to 2. By June 2022, he admitted that he was wrong about the path inflation would take. The US government has always paid its bills, and US treasuries are considered the safest asset in the financial system. The chairman suggests slowing down the economy to bring down inflation and questions whether to continue raising interest rates for a second year.

**Most Bearish Reason They Have for Why This Is Going to Happen by the FED & US Government**

1. The overall debt is $31 trillion, with small businesses being hit hard, especially those with 50 employees or less.
2. Inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1, and dealing with inflation is the number one hardship for many Americans.
3. The witness claimed that inflation would be temporary and brief, but a year later in June 2022, inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1.
4. The increase in IRS funding is aimed at improving their ability to serve Americans and ensure that everyone pays their fair share of taxes, which could lead to higher tax compliance and potentially higher taxes for some individuals and businesses.
5. The discussion revolves around various economic policies and proposals, with some expressing concerns about deficits, borrowing, inflation, and dependence on other countries.
6. The Treasury Secretary delayed announcing the debt limit until January 13th due to massive spending packages, which could suggest a lack of confidence in the government's ability to manage its finances.
7. The chairman suggests slowing down the economy to bring down inflation and questions whether to continue raising interest rates for a second year, which could negatively impact economic growth and employment.",Frequent-Ebb6310,12,1678487182.0

As for me,  likely by Monday morning I'll be looking to short on an equal weight basis (since smaller companies are more likely to be impacted) - though I'm going to review financials this weekend. If a company has no cash on hand, they have less to lose, for example.   Currently I don't have any positions, I spent too long writing this up and the market closed.

11nyqad,What happens when a Hacker takes a look at the market? You get this #VIX ownage,"TLDR - Put a rag tag team together to see what we find when we analyze the entire market's option chain. Grabbed a couple ethical hackers, a machine learning engineer, a software engineer, a data scientist, and a financial analyst.

Came up with something we call - Juice, which is volatility skew by tenor. That is a fancy way to say we track puts to calls in a dynamic oscillator so see if the option chain is normal or if there are anomalies. We smooth out the noise by having a look back and looking at 18 variations of skew, or juice rather.

Sometimes we use price to calculate Juice, sometimes IV, sometimes we use Greeks. The thing is - what works today, doesn't work in perpetuity so we monitor all of it and update the algorithms based on weighted back tests and esoteric models.

What matters is - Juice, can have predictive power, and the option chain can (not always) but can and does act as a leading indicator.

Again, not all the time. Market makers will come in here and say Volatility skew doesn't show much, and sure, the base calculation doesn't, but when you slice it like we do, we have found the opposite to be true.

I use it in two ways - One, I look for the rare occasions to go long with a Squeeze play that pays of 15 - 100x, we have all been there, and that's why we are here, but those are rare events. So if Juice isn't lighting up on multiple variations - I don't play those events, and I miss some squeezes, but that also increases my R:R since I am not always swinging for grand slams.

The other majority of the year, I stick with short vol, and collect premium. And if skew lights up enough, maybe I go with something like short vol and a 2 sigma OTM option because black scholes doesn't correctly price those in times of extreme vol. These are called ""units"" and learned about them from the book option traders hedge fund.

Here is a look at Juice on VIX and SPY, blue line is price, and the other lines are skew with varied forms of moneyness.

11nuu67,Microsoft Announces ChatGPT-4 release next week ($MSFT)," The website ""interestingengineering.com"" published an article on ChatGPT-4 on July 23, 2021, where it speculated on potential improvements and capabilities of the model. Some of these improvements could include enhanced natural language processing, better creativity, and problem-solving abilities, as well as increased personalization and improved multi-lingual capabilities.

The exact details and specifications of ChatGPT-4 are unknown as it is still in the development phase, and the model's release date remains unannounced. However, it is expected to build on the capabilities of its predecessor, ChatGPT-3, which is known for its ability to generate human-like text, translate languages, and even create music and artwork.

Overall, ChatGPT-4 has the potential to further advance the field of artificial intelligence and open up new possibilities for natural language processing, machine learning, and human-machine interaction.

As an AI language model, ChatGPT-4 will likely be an even more advanced version of me, ChatGPT-3, with improvements in performance and capabilities. Here are some potential things ChatGPT-4 might be able to do:

1. Improved language processing: ChatGPT-4 could be better at understanding and processing human language than its predecessors. It may be able to understand more complex sentence structures, nuances of language, and contextual cues.
2. Enhanced creativity: ChatGPT-4 might be capable of generating more creative and original content, such as music, art, and poetry.
3. Better problem-solving: With increased computing power, ChatGPT-4 could be more adept at solving complex problems, such as mathematical equations, scientific hypotheses, or even philosophical debates.
4. Increased personalization: ChatGPT-4 may be able to personalize its responses to individual users based on their past interactions, preferences, and behaviors.
5. Improved multi-lingual capabilities: ChatGPT-4 could be better at translating between different languages, allowing for more seamless communication between people who speak different languages.

Of course, these are just some possibilities for what ChatGPT-4 might be capable of. The exact capabilities of the model will depend on the advances in AI technology and the specific design and training of the model.

Firstly, MSFT is investing heavily in AI and machine learning, and ChatGPT-4 could be a significant advancement in these fields. By improving the model's language processing, personalization, and problem-solving abilities, Microsoft could use ChatGPT-4 to develop new products and services that could enhance their existing offerings or create entirely new revenue streams.

Secondly, MSFT is a major player in the cloud computing industry, and AI models like ChatGPT-4 require significant computing resources to train and operate. By developing more advanced AI models, Microsoft could attract more customers to their cloud computing services, which could result in increased revenue for the company.

Thirdly, AI models like ChatGPT-4 are trained on vast amounts of data, and Microsoft has access to significant amounts of data from its products and services, such as Bing, Office 365, and LinkedIn. By using this data to train ChatGPT-4, Microsoft could potentially gain insights and improve its offerings further, giving them a competitive advantage over other companies.

Overall, ChatGPT-4 could benefit MSFT by enabling them to develop new products and services, attracting more customers to their cloud computing services, and gaining insights from their vast data sets.

It requires having equity in a home or a really good credit score and friends at the local bank.

I will use home equity for the example. Borrow $50k against your home at 4.5% on a 5 year term.

Your payment will be $900 something.

You throw it all into OUT, an advertising REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust). It pays 7.5% annually higher - earning you higher interest then you are paying.

This is the hard part. You need cashflow to make the payments - if you are short you end up selling some OUT to pay back the loan and you start to cannibalize yourself.

Fuck that cannibalizism is found upon and sucks. So, instead we do the degen strat.

When the market recovers, ad dollars will be flying! So this REIT is positioned to climb back into the $20s.

Let's say it manages to get back to $20 from where it's at right now ($16 and change) in a year. Your OUT position is now worth $62k, plus your compounded reinvested dividends you are looking at paying back that $50k loan and having an $15k free and clear position in OUT making you 7.5% on that $15k every year for the rest of your life.

It only takes being able to make the monthly on the loan, and hitting a little degen luck.

Excerpt from a piece on the Atlantic Council

However, this has come at a high cost: the intrusive role of the Fed in money market activities. MMFs and other players have been incentivized to rely on the Fed‚Äôs ON RP/RRP facility. They enjoy practically zero counterparty risk and use top quality government securities as collateral at remunerative rates. But they tend to reduce dealings with other private sector entities using private investment instruments as a result. This has already been reflected in the daily transaction volume in various money markets at the end of 2022: $2.55 trillion in the ON RRP market; around¬†$1 trillion in all private repo markets used to calculate the secured overnight offer rate (SOFR)¬†as the new money market benchmark rate replacing the Libor (London Interbank Offer Rate‚Äîbeing discontinued due to accusations of rate manipulation by banks); and around¬†$100 billion in the interbank Fed funds market. *If these trends continue they will marginalize the role of private markets for short-term funds, weakening the usefulness of market price signals arising through the autonomous supply and demand for funds among private entities.*

Nio is among the few electric vehicle stocks that could rise in 2023 despite the challenges.

**Nio** **(**[**NIO**](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/nio/) **-4.25%)**, a stock that rode the [electric vehicle (EV)](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/automotive-stocks/electric-car-stocks/) hype in 2021, turned out to be among the biggest losers in 2022 -- it plunged 69% last year. Yet, unlike most EV manufacturers, Nio continued to deliver throughout the year, but its shares were caught in the stock market carnage as investors dumped growth stocks amid macroeconomic fears.

At current prices, Nio could be a rare opportunity to buy a growth stock in a fast-growing industry. Here are the three biggest reasons why Nio stock is a solid buy right now for 2023.

## 1. One big threat to Nio stock is behind it

Chinese stocks came under intense selling pressure last year on fears of getting delisted from the U.S. stock exchanges if the foreign companies didn't provide the U.S. regulators full access to audit reports. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission even publicly named more than 100 Chinese companies that faced the risk, including Nio. The EV maker quickly listed its shares in Hong Kong and Singapore as a hedge against potential delisting from the U.S.

Collapseüì∑

## [NYSE: NIO](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/nio/)

**Nio**Today's Change**(-4.25%) -$0.39**Current Price**$8.79YTD1W1M3M6M1Y5Y****PRICE****VS S&P** NIO

### KEY DATA POINTS

Market Cap**$15B**Day's Range**$8.71 - $9.17**52wk Range**$8.31 - $24.43**Volume**48,894,342**Avg Vol**46,340,540**Gross Margin**10.44%**Dividend Yield**N/A**

The good news is that there's finally been a breakthrough in the U.S.-China standoff, with U.S. regulators recently stating that they were able to ""perform full and thorough inspections and investigations"" on Chinese companies for the ""first time in history."" In other words, the risk of delisting is averted, and that's big news for Chinese stocks like Nio.

That brings us to the other big reason why Nio stock has been under so much pressure in recent months: the raging COVID-19 pandemic in China. But as we'll see, Nio should be able to navigate this storm too.

## 2. Nio has a busy year ahead¬†

COVID-19 lockdowns forced key manufacturing regions in China to shut down multiple times in 2022. With Nio also temporarily suspending operations at least twice in the year, investors were afraid the EV maker would not grow.

Nio's monthly deliveries did fluctuate in 2022, and the company even slashed its fourth-quarter deliveries outlook sharply in December after China's easing of its zero-COVID policy triggered a fresh wave of coronavirus cases.

Yet Nio eventually didn't just *beat* its revised Q4 outlook but delivered a record number of vehicles in the quarter, up 51% year over year. Nio's deliveries in 2022 rose 34% over 2021, which was again impressive, given the persistent production and supply chain constraints.

Equally important, Nio stuck with its growth plans in 2022 and started deliveries of three EVs on its second-generation technology platform NT2.0 -- sedans ET7 and ET5, and SUV ES7.

üì∑

IMAGE SOURCE: NIO.

ET5, in particular, is proving to be a game changer thanks to its competitive pricing. The premium midsize sedan's preorders beat Nio's own expectations, and the company delivered its first ET5 on Sept. 30, 2022. Nio then rapidly ramped up production and sold 7,594 ET5s in December versus 221 units in September.¬†

In December, ET5 even landed a spot on the 10 best-selling premium sedans list in China. In fact, only two all-electric cars made it to the list, and both belonged to Nio: ET5 and ET7.

If Nio could grow in a challenging year like 2022, it should be able to do so in 2023 as well, even if COVID continues to disrupt operations in China. The company's plans for 2023 for now do look impressive.¬†

[Nio expects to have five new models by mid-2023](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/01/12/down-66-in-this-bear-market-can-nio-stock-recover/), including a **Tesla** Model Y rival, as [Nio tries to play catch-up with the EV leader](https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/12/27/my-top-beaten-down-ev-stock-to-buy-hold-decade/) to capture a bigger share of China's EV market. Meanwhile, Nio is expanding aggressively in Europe, where it's also extending its Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS) program. BaaS is a solid competitive advantage for Nio as customers can buy Nio EVs cheaper without battery packs and subscribe to plans to swap and upgrade batteries at Nio's swapping stations. Nio is also already building a mass-market EV that could be ready for deliveries by late 2024 and could sell 50,000 units a month.

## 3. Nio stock looks cheap now

For all the growth and opportunities, Nio stock looks cheap right now, and that's perhaps the biggest reason why you'd want to buy the EV stock now.

Nio's deliveries are hitting record highs, and the company's full-year 2022 revenue could grow by at least 25%. Yet Nio stock is trading at a valuation it last saw in 2020, or a price-to-sales ratio of about 2.9.

üì∑

[NIO PS RATIO](https://ycharts.com/companies/NIO/ps_ratio) DATA BY [YCHARTS](https://ycharts.com/)

This looks like a solid entry point for anyone waiting to buy Nio stock and bet on China's explosive EV market. Indeed, China is the world's largest EV market -- sales there almost doubled in 2022, and it sold nearly 6.9 million EVs, almost five times than sold in the U.S.

Here's the most fascinating number: EVs accounted for 25% of China's total new car sales in 2022, a goal Chinese President Xi Jinping originally expected to achieve by 2025. Nio is growing steadily and wants to make the most of the EV boom in China, and that makes it a compelling EV stock to buy now for 2023 and beyond.",MogamboKushhua468,6,1678431757.0

11nge13,Non-farm interpretation,"As shown in the figure,

Traders are ramping up bets on the Fed's 50 basis point hike in March, with fed funds futures now showing a more than 80% chance of a 50 basis point hike, up from about 70% on Wednesday and 31% likely before Powell's first testimony.

Investors are now digesting Congress testimony from Fed Chairman Colin Powell and the ADP data that suggests the labor market is still fairly hot, as Powell clearly lowered the threshold for a 50 basis point rate hike in March,

That means that if Friday's jobs data were strong, it would be enough to make a 50-basis-point March rate hike a more likely outcome.

One of my news in Powell's testimony at the time was that he indicated more clearly the possibility of a bigger rate hike, and did not mention a preference for a 25 basis point increase.

So a strong non-farm payrolls data on Friday could trigger calls for a terminal interest rate of 6%.

11ndrbd,Unrealized Losses Run Rampant,"Ponder this. Long post, so I apologize ahead of time, but I feel this is an incredibly important topic many should know. For my friends interested in finance. Today‚Äôs important topic: Interest Rate Risk. This may not be important to many, but it very well may be soon. 

Per Goldman Sachs, 98% of mortgage loans currently have a rate below 6%, with a super-majority portion of these loans having rates far below today‚Äôs prevailing mortgage interest rate of ~7%. The vast majority of these mortgage loans are long duration 30-year fixed, and approximately 65% of these loans are securitized, including being rolled into mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Large holders of MBS and other mortgage securities include banks, pension funds, retirement accounts, etc., and of course the Federal Reserve. It is no secret banks especially have acquired large sums of MBS (and other mortgage securities) over the years in their liquidity portfolios. A considerable portion of these holdings are classified on balance sheet as available-for-sale, an important accounting designation in this instance.

Finance 101 dictates that when interest rates rise, bond valuations decline, and vice versa. In this economy, interest rates have risen dramatically from their historically-low trough levels during 2020, 2021, and the first quarter of 2022. The rate of change has been historical. Mortgages are bonds and are particularly rate sensitive, given the long duration nature. Mortgage bond prices are getting smashed. Why does this matter??

The level of unrealized losses in the United States economy tied to mortgages and related securities is absolutely MASSIVE today. These unrealized losses become a tremendous problem if the losses must be recognized, traditionally, via a sale of the assets (or mark to market accounting). With a looming recession on the horizon, this is a glaring potential problem, especially if inflation proves persistent (higher interest rates for longer) and liquidity and credit conditions contract further. 

The risks on the horizon should not be underestimated. Prudent risk management of ones personal and business finances are ever-more crucial today. Interest rate risk is elevated at historical levels, never witnessed by most of us in our lifetimes. It‚Äôs important not to fear heightened risk, but to prepare diligently when faced with it. Hopefully this helps someone out there.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%. (Stats as of 2023-02-28)",hardyrekshin,17,1678418295.0

**The lender‚Äôs problems stemmed partly from age-old banking risks such as concentration and matching assets and liabilities**

Silvergate Capital  was in the newfangled business of cryptocurrency banking. But it  ran into some very old banking problems‚Äîwhich could rattle investors in  traditional lenders, too.

The California bank said Wednesday that it intends to wind down and plans to return all deposits. Though Silvergate‚Äôs customers were once cryptocurrency exchanges  such as Coinbase Global and FTX, its core banking activity was actually  quite familiar: holding deposits of ordinary dollars from those  customers and investing in government-backed securities. And therein  lies the concerning part for bank investors.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5lndut5watma1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5a1321c4f8f09d4fd350cebc44db03487a3d43e1

Unlike some bank failures of recent memory, Silvergate didn‚Äôt  have bad assets in the sense of risky loans or complex derivatives. In  fact, its assets were mostly unassailable things like U.S. Treasurys and  agency mortgage-backed securities. But credit risk‚Äîor the risk of not  being paid back‚Äîisn‚Äôt the only kind of risk banks face. Securities such  as these carry interest-rate risk.

So **when rates surged as the Federal Reserve hiked in 2022,  Treasurys and mortgage bonds plunged in price**. Now if a bank is able to hold on to these securities until they mature,  it doesn‚Äôt ultimately lose anything. **The problem comes if a bank needs  to sell them before maturity, crystallizing the losses in their market  value. Silvergate has said it had to sell securities amid its deposit outflows**.

Banks can plan for this risk by aiming to match the duration of  their liabilities, which includes deposits, to their assets. For  example, if a bank is getting funding via a one-year certificate of  deposit, it can buy a Treasury maturing in one year to match. But if a  bank‚Äôs deposits can move at any moment, it has to weigh that risk when  investing.

A bank could just keep all its money in cash. But to earn more,  banks need to take more risk. They can manage this by building up a mix  of deposits that don‚Äôt all move or reprice at once. This is done by  diversifying across customer and account types, or by adding term  deposits such as CDs. Banks also diversify with assets that are floating  rate, like many kinds of corporate loans or credit card loans.

So most banks aren‚Äôt subject to risks of a single industry such  as crypto. Having so much of its funding coming from similar types of  depositors turned out to be one of Silvergate‚Äôs biggest risks. But there  are still echoes across banking. For one, the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corp. reports that banks had unrealized losses on securities of about $620 billion as of the fourth quarter. Plus, banks‚Äô deposits are starting to move more quickly,  and against the backdrop of the Fed‚Äôs aggressive rate increases and the  unusual postpandemic economy, it isn‚Äôt clear exactly what their  ultimate velocity will be. Notably, valuable deposits on which banks don‚Äôt pay any interest have been declining.

Banks generally have a number of sources of liquidity and have  diversified over time. Few are at risk of needing to wind down so  quickly. But many may still have to take actions  throttling back on  loan growth or raising more capital if the Fed keeps going and deposits  flee more quickly than anticipated.

Silvergate may have been an unusual bank. But its story carries old lessons that all investors sometimes need to relearn.",polloponzi,39,1678410622.0

11n9r7u,I sold my 0dte spy puts too early today and I need to tell someone,"Hi, I'd like to apply to be the head dummy around these parts...For context I swung spy calls overnight (like a buffoon but it worked out) and sold them at open at the high. I felt like a king. Immediately following after, I dumped my winnings into spy puts because why stop gambling at 10 am when the market closes at 430? So I did just that. Dumped around 600 bucks into 398 poots (I know I'm not super baller like some of these idiots in this sub)

I had a rule though.... I told myself that once I hit a certain profit, I will sell half and then at another level sell the other half. I **know** 0dte contracts on spy wither away as fast as you can say ""my wife's boyfriend"". Spy dropped quick enough for me to see some profits and gaze at my phone while my boss asked when is this big project done. He could kick rocks for all I cared. I made his monthly pay in 20 minutes on my phone. Eventually spy dropped more for me to sell all my puts. I felt great I liked the price I sold at. Spy hit a reversal heading back up and I felt like I played the Wall St. Cucks in NYC. 

After showboating for a mere 10 minutes, Spy dropped......and dropped....and kept....on.....dropping. I was shocked. I was terrified to look at what my 398 puts were at. I sold at $1.00 a contract (100 dollars each for the idiots). And these contracts hit $7.00 each. I wanted to cry just thinking about it. With tears in my eyes I pulled out my calculator and did the math. It was disgusting what I missed out on. My measly $2400 cash in my Robinhood didn't compare to the $11,000 (or so) missed profit. 

I felt like I just got punished for listening to myself and following my rules. Why couldn't I have just let them *rideeee* out. 

Anyway I was so furious the entire day and just had to write this out. I may just take the remaining money and spend it on something that won't stab me in the ^(fukin) heart like these puts did to my soul. Just kidding, I dumped half my equity into Aapl calls for tomorrow. I literally cannot wait for them to expire worthless so I can quit trading.

A total drop of almost $11 from HOD. What caused this sell off?

I said it this morning and I say it every day‚Ä¶ play what the market gives‚Ä¶ yes 100% we need to take into consideration the macro movements intraday but going into a day fully biased is not a smart idea. Many people were extremely bullish this morning and thought we would see a huge bull trend day‚Ä¶

Looking at this article here it appears there is a market wide bank liquidity crunch starting. That fear could have been the driving force behind this sell off‚Ä¶ (for anyone who didn‚Äôt see SIVBs option chain EOD today one of the puts was up 500k% which I think is the biggest gain I have ever seen on a single options trade‚Ä¶). 

The question know is as these banks and assets firms start to fall.. whos next? How big will this go? Could this be our black swan event? Stay tuned to find out‚Ä¶

Honestly one of the most incredible things about this nearly -2% drop and total $10.95 HOD to LOD sell off is that the chances of a 50bps has severely decreased from around 80% before the jobless data was released this morning until market close today. Not only that but the 10YR sold off with SPY today and so did DXY. 

That is very interesting thing to note about this sell off for sure and will be critical to watch as we close the week out tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f3prnu0pnsma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4b6bf1c2c312d20a8b25ea77c6ed38a902291250

Tomorrow is another incredibly important data day that should move the markets. We are going to get employment report (nonfarm payroll), the unemployment rate and also the wages data. These numbers are going to be what put the odds of a 50bps back at 80% or down to 25% or lower EOD tomorrow‚Ä¶ Not only that we are going to get the all so important (to me at least) CPI consensus released tomorrow. 

Knowing the Friday morning data should give investors a chance to know what the 25 or 50bps rate hike will be. Plus this will give us a better sneak peek of what CPI YoY/ MoM will be. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cl4rxdgpnsma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5383b3ccc427e81d31ba15cdbad0313191170037

Bears put in an impressive show today and took us under not only 394.64 demand (support) but took us below the low from last weeks sell off. It took 3 days to go from 392.3 to 407.45 and took 3 days to go right back to these levels (and lower). 

From a demand and supply stand point we are in the waiting period. We have potential to establish a new demand, however, we need minimally one green day if not two before we will see that happen. The biggest thing I am watching here is that 388.52 demand (support). Not only that but as you can see we have that previous supply at 383.82 sitting there still. 

This 383.82 could very well be a down side target. With us being 2% from that level IF we get bearish data in the morning (this would be data that shows a STRONG economy) which would be a very low UE rate and very high wages then I would actually not be too surprised to see us push all the way down to that level. 

From a bullish stand point the bulls ideal situation here would be a break down to 383.82 and then a massive bounce (which would come Monday) to then turn that level into a demand (support). Turning a previous supply (and taking a hanging supply like this off the books) into a demand would establish a very strong support area and would be extremely bullish going forward. 

From a bearish standpoint we are still working our way down and right now there is very little reason to bet on a bounce. Momentum is carrying us down and we are at least two trading days away from any sort of sustained bounce. Bears would like to get this under 388.52 demand and possibly take out that supply. There ideal situation would then be a short bounce back to either 388.52 or 394.68 to then turn that into supply (resistance) before seeing a lower push. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ke13841qnsma1.png?width=888&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=27a7d370ba40efb197acbfdd87449c6044660c06

Both of these are a daily chart here but zoomed way out to show you better just how actually bearish this breakdown today was. 

So from a very zoomed out stand point we broke the black support line. What is the significance of that black support line? Well this is the recovery line from the October low to last weeks low. We have now broke then again which should and could signify further downside to go. 

Not only that but we were working on a shorter timeframe blue/black breakout/down triangle that we have now officially lost support on. And the red falling wedge that we were trading within has also had its support broken. Many many supports and key levels being broken today. 

The one key level that did not break and we came within 43 cents of is the key pivot point of 390.1. We did come close to it yet we failed to break through it. This will be the major level to watch tomorrow. 

With this rejection off the daily 20ema and closing once again back below the 8, 20, 50, 100 and 200ema there are two ways to see this‚Ä¶ 

The first choice is to see this as a clear consolidation area from 390 to 405 (one could even infer there is a 390 to 414 consolidation area that dates back to beginning of January). If you see this as a consolidation whether short or longer timeframe then this is officially your bounce and call opportunity area. 

However, if you see this as a clear lower high (420 -> 392 -> 406 -> 390) then this is the start of an even bigger sell off. 

Now the one wildcard (well two) that we have here is all the data tomorrow and then CPI print next Tuesday. This is a fairly tough place for markets to be in and even tougher for investors. My personal thoughts are that as long as we maintain 390 support and we don‚Äôt see incredibly bearish (strong economy data) tomorrow then we should hold 390 and relief bounce back to the 393-395 area to close the week out. However, IF we get massively bearish data tomorrow then I would set my ultimate target at 383.8 supply. 

SPY Levels: 

Supply: 383.82 -> 405.17  
 Demand: 394.68 -> 388.52 -> 376.67  
 Daily Support: 390.1 -> 388.7 -> 387.2 -> 385.2  
 Daily Resistance: 394.7 -> 395.5 -> 397.8

**FUTURE DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pbja3gtsnsma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5db851eaa7cf5a8f93ceceb9c0a3a73490236913

Now look at futures we have an absolutely beautiful support bounce of 3920. I am first of incredibly impressed we broke through 3960 and even hit 3920 but Its even more impressive that we held it the way we did. 

Bulls have a real opportunity here on futures to reconfirm this as a demand (support) which would be incredibly bullish and would in my opinion certainly lead to an upside push. 

The structure here on futures is actually slightly different than SPY supply/ demand in the sense that instead of having a downside supply to take out we have a wide open gap on the daily futures chart from current 3920 demand (support) to 3833 demand (support). 

If the bears target a downside push tomorrow that would be where I would start to eye which would be a -2.3%. Now that is a pretty big target, however, if we get really bearish data its possible for sure. 

Bears goal would be a closure somewhere between 3833 and 3920 tomorrow to then turn around and short bounce back to 3920 or 3960 and turn that demand into a supply (new resistance). If they do that they very well could target the 3600-3700s‚Ä¶ IF data supports the move. 

Bulls goal tomorrow is to double bottom futures of 3920 (that means a closure over 3920 but preferably over 3960). They then want to reconfirm 3920 as demand (which means as least 2 days of green) and start a push back to 4055. 

**FUTURE DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gnqe6bbtnsma1.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=93d2ad00170d4f081e813396ff3172d899c84eff

From a weekly price action stand point similar break down here on futures through the October recovery blue support line and also falling out of the breakout/down triangle. For those of you that do not remember 3920 is the incredibly important pivot point that is similar to that of 390.1. With futures stopping and more importantly closing over that 3920 today that is actually somewhat bullish as this could as I said under spy be a bigger 3920-4095 range that we are once again finding bottom in. 

However, if this sell of continues we have some pretty strop support to watch for in the 3810-3830 range that would be my ultimate downside target. 

Futures levels-

Supply: 4055 -> 4160  
 Demand: 3960 -> 3920 -> 3833  
 Daily support: 3920 -> 3895 -> 3872 -> 3830  
 Daily Resistance- 3955 -> 3990

**SPY/ FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY/ DEMAND TEASER**

From a weekly standpoint here spy is looking at a target of 382.2 as its closest level. If bulls can close us short of that and close us green next week we actually could see a new higher demand (support) established here which could open up the upside back to that 412.5 area. 

However, on futures we have lost critical 3971 demand (support) and now are closing in on 3864 demand (support). That would be a more reasonable -1.5% target for tomorrow. From there bulls if they can hold that level which is major support from the December lows we could (Again if data supports) see  a bounce and weekly double bottom off 3864. In the off chance that 3971 is recovered tomorrow we could see futures weekly barcode and potentially either turn a double bottom off 3971 back to 4055 or start the descent to 3864 then. 

Its hard to have a true answer of where this will go when this market is so sensitive and data dependent right now. 

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iiqq7a9xnsma1.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c046c9f63804020a4b6057b2eafd26154529acaa

The most impressive thing about the vix is that prior to this breakout it actually came down and perfectly touched that support line for the breakout/down triangle before it had a massive breakout. With an 18.62% green close today this is the biggest move the VIX has seen since June 13th 2022 which was a 22.67% green move up‚Ä¶ If you remember this time period was around rate hike/ cpi news. 

Also for reference that day on SPY it closed -3.8% red‚Ä¶ vs the relatively small -1.84% red day spy had today‚Ä¶ 

This also the highest level the VIX has been since February 22nd . With data tomorrow IF that data comes in extremely bearish we could very well see the VIX push even higher tomorrow until we get the CPI reading next Tuesday. 

However, one thing that‚Äôs interesting to note is that almost every single time the VIX does have a massive breakout like this it within 1-2 days has a sizeable retrace. 

Something else that I find intriguing is that the VIX spiked today but did not earlier in the week with the 50bps news and everything else. This tells me that markets truly do not believe we get at 50bps, however, markets are fearful a bank liquidity crisis.

Not a whole lot to report today on DXY besides it did hard reject off that 105.6 doji from yesterday and is now coming back down to test its daily 8ema support. We are still maintaining its rising wedge and will continue to watch to see if this or the 10YR breaks support before CPI next week.

Now this is where its interesting to look and see the difference between everything that is happening. The 10yr had a -2.15% drop today which is a very large sell off considering SPY put in nearly a 2% red day‚Ä¶ this tells us that markets are not as worried about inflation and the 50bps hike as they were earlier this week. With this rising wedge finally broken on 10YR I will be watching DXY closely and we very well as I have said see a CPI rally into FOMC.

[Today was a good day in the end but actually was a frustrating day to trade. I once again‚Ä¶ twice‚Ä¶ found myself being sold heavily on the fake bullish breakout before a massive sell off occurred. ](https://preview.redd.it/15quc5nvnsma1.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d177fa2e4ad4b7271b389cb15d70eee68cbc3ac6)

I didn‚Äôt trade anything after 1pm today as by that point I honestly just couldn‚Äôt find an entry that looked good enough (it realistically never pulled back far enough to not be FOMO for me), I stopped trusting the sell off and then I had to take off early before EOD. 

It was a good day in the sense that I followed my rules and once again didn‚Äôt break them. I also cut my losers early this time which along with a -10% stop loss has been incredibly helpful in my trading results.

11mzwhs,"In just a few minutes this week, Powell changed everything on market‚Äôs view of interest rates","*  **Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell set out a new paradigm for how the central bank views its policy path, one that apparently will see even higher interest rates for a longer period of time.**
* **Markets now strongly expect a half-point increase in March and the peak, or terminal rate, to hit close to 5.75% before the Fed is finished.**
* **What changed was the January inflation data, plus signs that the labor market remains remarkably strong despite the Fed‚Äôs efforts to slow it down.**

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell‚Äôs prepared speech this week to Congress took just a few minutes, but it changed everything.

In those remarks, the central bank leader set out a new paradigm for how the Fed views its policy path, one that apparently will see even higher interest rates for a longer period of time than previously thought.

The aftermath has forced the market, which long had been looking for the Fed to blink in its inflation fight, to recalibrate its own views to coincide more with policymakers who have been warning about a higher-for-longer approach to interest rates.

‚ÄúWe have clearly had a choreographed chorus of Fed speakers for two weeks that was getting us to that place,‚Äù said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management. ‚ÄúIt took Jay Powell, over the course of a very brief prepared statement and a Q&A, to get those expectations cemented into a higher place.‚Äù

As part of his mandated semiannual testimony on monetary policy, Powell spoke Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee then the day after to the House Financial Services Committee.

Heading into the appearances, markets had been looking for the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage point at its meeting later this month, then perhaps two more moves before stopping, with the end point around 5.25%.

That changed after Powell‚Äôs appearance, during which he cautioned that if inflation data remains strong, he expects rates to go ‚Äúhigher than previously anticipated‚Äù and possibly at a faster pace than a quarter point at a time.

Markets now strongly expect a half-point increase in March and the peak, or terminal rate, to hit close to 5.75% before the Fed is finished.

11mywzp,INVA (Innovia) Value Play?,"Innoviva is a biopharmaceutical company that focuses on developing and commercializing respiratory medicines. The company collaborates with global pharmaceutical companies to develop and market a portfolio of respiratory products, including inhalers and other treatments for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Innoviva is headquartered in Brisbane, California, and operates in the United States and Europe. The company aims to improve the lives of patients with respiratory diseases by providing effective treatments and innovative therapies. But most importantly, profit for shareholders.

&#x200B;

At the time of writing 09/03/2023 the stock price is $10.70 with a market cap of circa $750 million and a P/E of 5. The recent drop in share price seems to be driven by Q4 results which shows some concerns as the company's gross royalties collected are slightly lower compared to the year prior. The biggest criticism of the business is perhaps the lack of product diversification as shareholders worry that these royalties cannot last forever. However, Inva has addressed this through acquisitions and mergers buying companies with innovative products and the potential of providing new long term revenue streams.

&#x200B;

 On the flip side, Innoviva Inc. recently announced that its investigational drug, SUL-DUR, has been accepted for priority review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (ABC), including multi-drug resistant and carbapenem-resistant strains. The NDA submission is based on results from the landmark Phase 3 ATTACK trial, where SUL-DUR demonstrated non-inferiority versus colistin in patients with carbapenem-resistant ABC infections and a significant difference in clinical cure rates. SUL-DUR also exhibited a favorable safety profile with statistically significant reduction in nephrotoxicity. The FDA's decision to accept the NDA for priority review and hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application could potentially change the stock sentiment for Innoviva, as this brings the company closer to potentially delivering SUL-DUR to patients in this area of high unmet medical need. The market for antibiotics is vast, and the Qualified Infectious Disease Product designation of SUL-DUR may provide Innoviva with a competitive advantage. 

&#x200B;

Seems like it may be a gamble based on FDA approval but even without the new drug INVA will continue to try and innovate so I do believe it will rebound eventually. If FDA approval is given for their new product we may see big moves as with other biopharma companies.

11my1t5,Room-Temperature Superconductivity Claimed ‚Äì TSM Play,"  

On Wednesday, March 8, 2023, scientists from the University of Rochester claimed to have found evidence of a superconductor that operates at room temperature. 

Like fusion power, room-temperature superconductors are a dream that every scientist and engineer desperately wants to come true. Unlike traditional conductors, which have some inherent resistance, a superconductor is a material with zero resistance, meaning that a current that flows through a superconductor never loses energy. 

Superconductors are already used in applications that require massive currents and magnetic fields, such as MRI machines, which take advantage of superconducting rings that can maintain a circular current that never dies.

Superconductivity is a state of matter in which electrical resistance in a material drops to zero while its electrical and magnetic capacity vastly expands. Assuming it is affordable and able to be made into wire then you could use it for electricity transmission with essentially no loss in power. Currently 5% to 10% of the electricity distributed from generator to consumers is lost to heat from the cables.

Until now, the phenomenon has been observed only at freezing temperatures or unbelievably high pressures. Room temperature semi-conductors could open pathways to lossless electric transmission, high-efficiency electric motors, maglev trains, and low-cost magnets for MRIs and nuclear fusion.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: **TSM**) is a Taiwan-based company mainly engaged in the provision of integrated circuit manufacturing services. They could benefit from this new breakthrough in the scientific community by providing a new product in energy, healthcare, infrastructure, and vehicles. TSM is an integrated circuit manufacturing services include process technology, special process technology, design ecosystem support, mask technology, 3DFabricTM advanced packaging and silicon stacking technology services. TSM has completed the transfer and mass production of 5nm technology, and is engaged in the research and development of 3nm process technology and 2nm process technology. The product application range covers the entire electronic application industry, including personal computers and peripheral products, information application products, wired and wireless communication system products, servers and data centers.

I think TSM will be an unexpected winner of this new scientific breakthrough.

11mr3ey,‚ÄòA terrible environment for equities‚Äô: Market veteran predicts the S&P 500 could drop of nearly 25% from current levels.,"The U.S. equity market is flashing warning signs, according to chief market strategist Chris Watling.

Watling, also the chief executive of London-based Longview Economics, expects stocks to fall into a bear market over the next three to six months thanks to lofty valuations driven higher since September last year.

The S&P 500 was trading at 3,985 on Wednesday morning at a price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 20x even as the U.S. central bank attempts to tighten financial conditions.

According to Watling, valuations are now in ‚Äúbubble‚Äù territory and have never been so high except during the dot-com and pandemic-era boom in stock prices.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a market here on a forward P/E ratio of 18 and a half times, which has only really been substantially higher in a bubble,‚Äù Watling told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box Europe.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a terrible environment for equities,‚Äù he added.

https://preview.redd.it/8gxy6modkpma1.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8f71ebb5c431df539c23f45be6330fa23213763c

When asked about a potential fall, Watling said investors should be cautious because if the S&P 500 earnings reverted to its historical mean, the benchmark could decline by 900 points ‚Äì a drop of nearly 25% from current levels.

‚ÄúIf you say that the \[S&P 500\] forward earnings should be 200, and you say that average multiple is 15 times, you get to a number of about 3000,‚Äù Watling said.

While investors may be tempted to stay in the market due to a lack of better options, Watling suggests otherwise.

‚ÄúIf you want to make money, you should be short equities over the three to six-month timeframe,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúYou should be overweight government bonds, should probably have a little bit in cash, and there‚Äôs certain commodities you should be playing, most likely the precious metals.‚Äù

He cautioned, however, that this strategy is very aggressive and unsuitable for the average investor.

Watling advised that investors should make diversified bets and not bet the house on one investment.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%. (Stats as of 2023-02-28)",hardyrekshin,14,1678332413.0
11mh5jc,Oi! Listen here ya little shits.,"Last week I worked with Reddit to send out a feedback survey, to get a sense of how much you're all liking WSB

Those who selected any option other than ""not at all"" will be spared.

Now that the results are back, let's dig in!

* 6010 messages were sent

* 119 were filled

* 2% response rate

So right off the bat, you lot are a bunch of lazy cunts. Unsurprising.

Are you at least satisfied cunts?

* 59% were satisfied with WallStreetBets

* 67% of all users in similar sized subreddits were satisfied

You telling me you enjoy r/EarthPorn more than WSB? There isn't even any porn there. I'll show you similarly sized...

Really though, what's the deal? I should have sent these surveys out to your wives.

* Did you all lose your lunch money?

* Was it because we haven't put rainbow dicks in the banner in a few months? 

* Is it because we haven't run a paper trading competition in a while?

Also, get this...

* 15% reported that they see harmful content on the sub multiple times a week.

The heck? It's not like *all* the posts here are shilling scams like PLTR and TSLA. 

There are some actually profitable companies posted here sometimes, like ~~GME~~, ~~BBBY~~, ~~AMC~~, uh... CVNA? is that profitable?

At least we did okay on the rules section:

* 63% said the rules were appropriate

* 64% said they were clear and easy to understand

Not bad, but I have a hard time believing nearly two thirds of you knobheads have ever read the rules.

As for fairness in moderation:

* 53% said we enforce the rules fairly

* 41% said we take feedback into account

* 56% trust us to make decisions that benefit the community

Eh, we could get elected on those numbers. Not bad.

And on something we've worked incredibly hard to preserve, subreddit culture:

* 57% said people generally behave (optimistc today, aren't we)

* 44% feel like a member of the subreddit

Confuscious once said, ""The man (or woman, get with the times) who thinks they are a member of WallStreetBets, and they who does not, are both right.""

~~~

I hope you guys enjoyed the results of our first survey, would love to get your insights on what's good and what isn't on WSB.

In preparation for the next survey, I will continue banning people until the numbers improve.

Finally, I'd like to end off with an anonymous quote from the survey:

""I'm on WallStreetBets to learn the dangers of YOLOing. I can safely say it's done a great job so far.""

11ma6zv,"Day two of JPOW: chopped up‚Ä¶ All eyes on Jobless Claims Tomorrow‚Ä¶ 3-8-23 SPY/ ES Futures, VIX, DXY and 10YR Yield Daily Market Analysis","Well this has to have been one of the most frustrating days I have traded in a long time. Absolutely zero follow through and some absolutely erratic candle movements chopped me up today. Lets take a look at where the dust has settled‚Ä¶ 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kboe7u8aclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d12f1d69dc7ae2f46b1678e26fecdf9a538b5f1c

All eyes are officially on jobless claims tomorrow‚Ä¶ why is jobless claims tomorrow important? JPOW the last two days has basically re-iterated and other fed talking points have continued to say that we are data dependent and even going into next FOMC we are data dependent. As you cans see by this chart here that we have been trending down on jobless claims (as in there are less and less people saying they are jobless) since December 11th and around the first week of February we ‚Äúbottomed.‚Äù 

The last 3 jobs claims has been higher than previous‚Ä¶ why does this matter? Because if job claims are rising now then that would indicate the economy is ‚Äúweakening‚Äù which then means the feds rate hikes are working. The biggest concern for the fed is that despite what they do the economy as it has since summer continues to ramp up. 

This number is projected at 195k tomorrow which would mean a 4th week in a row that claims rise (economy weakening) and that would be extremely bullishly received. However, if that number comes in below 193k again tomorrow that could signal jobs trending back down and the fears of a 50bps grow‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3zrqvvwaclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=47b3795e8f75c45449b253e81d33ffbed0279abc

As of now‚Ä¶ we have a 77.9% priced in chance (expectation) of a 50bps at the march 22nd meeting which I absolutely find incredible. This is where im at‚Ä¶   
 

markets gonna market until CPI -> CPI is going to come in better than expected (aka bullishly received) -> algos are gonna pick up on that and dump the chances of a 50bps to 0% that day‚Ä¶ -> massive rally into FOMC -> FOMC becomes the top when the dot plot and fed funds rate projections come out terribly hot and unexpected. 

I don‚Äôt think we actually get a 50bps‚Ä¶ unless we get a true CPI YoY/ MoM rebound which I don‚Äôt forsee, however, I am waiting for the consensus to come out this week still. 

**SPY SUPPLY/ DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gy2z0ahbclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a983b96730035c29843e9257607773176c2bc03b

Today the daily chart came down and touched the 396.54 supply. Now this came within 4 cents on the daily time frame which on a daily time frame is within the room of error. However, this is a key level to keep in mind if we reject the downside. With the current technical on SPY we are actually looking to establish a new demand (support) at this 398.2 range. If we were to put in a green day tomorrow, especially if we could see a close over 401.5 there is a solid chance that today and yesterdays lows establish a new demand (support) at 398.2‚Ä¶. a demand being established over previous demand at 394.68 would be extremely bullish and I would once again start thinking about a push back to the upper range resistance of 405.17. 

Spy very well leading into CPI next week could find itself stuck between a 398 and 405 choppy range. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yh1c6k1cclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bd18ecc3b2a050e2c84b40a140ffe8c0f18f8dcb

From a daily price action stand point we have reached a bounce point. This pattern actually is playing out beautifully. If you go back to Thursday we started a three day $12+ pump. It was natural to expect that to result in a retrace to back fill some of these levels. Now that we have back filled the actual daily gap and came down to find support on the daily 100ema‚Ä¶ with this morning doji start pattern we should expect a push back to 402 tomorrow minimally. That would put us back at a retest of the daily 20ema. 

Now that‚Äôs from strictly a technical standpoint‚Ä¶ IF jobs come in low and algos dump us then I would start targeting 394.6 demand area for a potential bounce. 

We have found ourselves exactly where we were on Monday. From a technical/ price action and even supply/ demand stand point this is 100% a call opportunity and I 100% expect upside‚Ä¶ however, much like Monday we had a major catalyst that can negate the technical temporarily or can support the technical much like Tuesday did. 

SPY Levels:

Supply- 405.17 -> 414.13   
 Demand- 394.68 -> 388.52  
 Daily support- 398.4 -> 396.4 -> 394.6 -> 392.6  
 Daily Resistance- 399.6 -> 401.5 -> 404.5

**FUTURES SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bjygdtmcclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2030405bcd62de1297f254d60312f102fa23ce0f

Taking a look at futures supply and demand we have found ourselves in ‚Äúno mans land.‚Äù We are under the recently established 4055 supply and we are just over the 3960 demand (support) below us. Looking at the technical if we were to have another bullish day tomorrow we could be attempting to establish todays low of 3990 as a new demand (support). That would much like SPYS daily S/D be very bullish. With the demands (supports) stacked like that from 3920 to potentially 3990 (this would also turn previous supply of 3990 into a new demand) that is very bullish. I would then look for a push back to 4055 and potentially even attempt to take out demand at 4096 if we got a big enough bounce. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vykt6q3dclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f51a5dc781a4e46a4c74477fe4f306d4f5407042

From a daily price action stand point on futures is much of the same with this classic morning doji star/ double bottom off 3990 support today. This on futures is also a retest and support holding for the 100ema. 

With this price action (again dependent on data‚Ä¶) we should see a push to the upside tomorrow. My ultimate futures target is 4020 which would give us a close back over the daily 8, 50 and 200ema and ultimately would make me expect a rally back to the 4053 supply and possibly even as high as 4095 on Friday depending on data. 

However, in the chance that data is negatively received my ultimate downside target is a support test of 3920. This should be a major support test and as long as that holds then ultimately we should expect a push back to the 4000s. However, a closure under 3920 would be extremely bearish and could very well start a further sell off. 

Futures Levels:

Supply: 4055 -> 4160  
 Demand: 3920 -> 3960 -> 4096  
 Daily Support- 3990 -> 3955  
 Daily Resistance- 4020 -> 4055 -> 4085

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cph6ti5eclma1.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0fc53da399a0b78e0eb4b8676ea6272ca7d0af5a

The VIX is actually in an interesting place. I also mentioned yesterday that I was surprise with the fact that a 50bps is now nearly 70%+ ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù that the VIX did not break through 19.7. That is very odd if you ask me‚Ä¶ now granted markets have absolutely been focusing on the use of 0dte options instead of longer DTE‚Ä¶ but if markets truly ‚Äúbelieved‚Äù that we were going to get 50bps, and that cpi would be red hot we would be seeing a much longer and more importantly sustained spike on the VIX. However, today we are seeing yet again the VIX unwind. 

The VIX remains at that 19.7 resistance at in a bear flag breakdown pattern that should lead once again to another drop to that 18.3 support rea. 

**DXY**

Now im going to start this with a disclaimer‚Ä¶ I generally have watched the DXY and 10yr yield since probably mid summer time. However, I have never once taken a trade solely based off it. I do enjoy watching in general dollar/ yield up = spy SHOULD be down‚Ä¶ now many of you know that does not always happen. Yields/ DXY have been moving in tandem with SPY which is interesting. Some are even saying that yields have finally gone too far‚Ä¶ however, long story short im going to start watching DXY more closely and see if we can see anything. Merely going to talk out loud and see if there is any bigger correlations we can catch. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z9q54dcfclma1.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=eb30751cb9524d4f752eafda6681c768a8016626

From a price action stand point DXY is in an overall massive rising wedge that dates back to January/ February. As of now price remains over its daily 8ema and had officially closed over the 105.6 level which was the high back form December. 

Just for reference at this time period when DXY was at 105.6 area in beginning of December SPY was at trading in the 380s range (this was directly post December CPI). This means we are about 4.7% higher on SPY now than we were back then. 

Current trend would allow for DXY to fall as low as 104.7 by Monday (day before CPI) and rise as high as 106.4. 

**10YR YIELD**

I am starting with the same disclaimer here that I am merely watching the 10yr like this in order to see if we catch anything to help us. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3kuzyfhgclma1.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=577c061cae9c1a841bedde96b9a9edac387c4d8a

The 10yr is in this same rising wedge pattern as DXY. Which I actually find interesting as SPY daily is in a breakout triangle pattern which I full expect it to hold within leading into CPI. This rising wedge on DXY/ 10yr COULD be the hint that we actually see a breakout to the upside on SPY which also supports my thesis on a bullishly received CPI. 

Currently the 10yr is sitting just under 4% after briefly breaching it today. For reference on the 10yr the last time it was this high was back in November. At which time SPY held that 395 to 405 range leading into CPI before it saw the bigger dump. In that sense we are actually spot on with where we should be here‚Ä¶ 

From a TA stand point we actually have a pretty nice but ugly head and shoulders or W pattern formed here with our lows at that 3.4% area and highs here at the 4% area‚Ä¶ that would indicate that the 10yr will sell off and that would lead to a pump on SPY‚Ä¶ 

Overall from a macro stand point 10yr and DXY suggest we are in a place where they are likely to retrace which might be support by jobs data and CPI and that could lead to a rally on SPY. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dov27gxgclma1.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ecae56dc960833f0454cd5fc2ce4053ddb1d43b4

I got pretty chopped up today and some how managed to put in a decently small red day and still have a pretty nice green week. I recognized early on today that morning range and chop. I took the first opportunity for a call when we broke out over 399 and closed there this morning and was immediately stopped out. With the massive wicks on the 15min chart I once again waited for the breakout and when we broke out around 1145 and closed a new HOD I once again was immediately stopped out. 

I still looking back have no good reason or data to support why from 12 until 130pm we went on that massive dump from HOD to LOD like that. It really was fully against the technical at the time.

Best play of the day was the 14dte calls I took near the 3971 support are on futures (a major weekly support). That rogue EOD pump printed calls nicely and turned what was going to be a pretty sour day into just an annoying day. 

Frustrating to feel like I was behind and buying the top/ bottom on every play. However, I will say that I followed my rules and almost every play I took everything I look for in an entry (especially the first 3 calls I stopped out of) were all 100% signaled.. as in I have everything I look for with a perfect call entry. I wont let one day change my strategy as its tried and true‚Ä¶ after a successful day yesterday with the volatility today was a humbling reminder that FED days do not generally fit into my ideal trading strategy. 

At the end of the day though tomorrows a new day and there will always be a new day‚Ä¶ we have to at time know when to walk away and know when the day just isn‚Äôt going to give us what we need.",DaddyDersch,88,1678314269.0

11m9mln,On why EVs and robotaxis are not going to create multi-trillion dollar companies...,"The EV hype is finally plateauing.

This is my articulation of what I expect to happen in this space.

The manufacturing techniques of Tesla are starting to be more widely adopted.  There are lots of other EV companies out there.  Many are going to fail in the next two or three years.  The ones that survive will be mass market.  EVs will be plentiful.

In the next decade, maybe EVs become 90+% of all new vehicles sold.  Margins will erode.  The market will look at lot like it does now, with a dozen companies that make the majority of vehicles on the road.  The names might be different ones, but the character of the market is going to be largely the same.

But, what about robotaxies and fully automated driving?  That's going to lead to massive profits, right?  Probably not.  An illustrative example, relevant to vehicles: in 2000, I bought an S500.  The nav. system was a $6,000 option, and the discs containing road data (yes, the data was on CDs that you put in a box in the trunk) were $250 a piece.  You needed 4 or 5 to cover the US.  By 2020, you would buy that same functionality for $200 (a phone) and $30/mo. for data.  *And* it gives you up to the minute traffic information to boot.  In roughly 20 years, the cost dropped by a factor of roughly 30.

Tesla is getting $15,000 for FSD.  Their window during which to charge this isn't going to be horribly long.  Due to the ever-increasing pace of technology advancement, that 30 factor that took 20 years before is likely to take 15 years now... maybe not even... maybe 10.

In 2033, I think you have fully automated driving for $300 additional cost (getting a car *without* the relevant hardware and software will actually be kinda difficult), and $30/mo. for data.  And that data will be necessary for a lot of reasons (up to date road information, software updates, etc., but *also* because your car is going to be talking to every other car in it's vicinity, constantly feeding each other sensor data).

Further, this technological advancement is likely to make the overall market for vehicles shrink, not grow, because who the hell wants to own a car if there's one on the corner that will pick you up 30 seconds after you request it?

Gradually, people's garages will be emptied of cars, and put to better use.  Like, for beer making equipment.

And you'll be subscribed to a new fangled ""livery service"" that you'll pay $x/mo. to be a member of, and maybe $y/mile.  The charges let the livery service company go out and acquire vehicles and maintain them.  They'll be very spartan.  Because no one wants to be cleaning barf off upholstery all the time, because these get used to get back from the bar.  But, you won't care, because cars are a massive hassle, and the few times a year you need one to go to the mountains, or take a road trip to Matamoros, you'll just rent one.

Anyways.  My thoughts.  If you're looking for a multi-trillion opportunity, it's going to have to be much more than EVs and robotaxis.  And insurance.  And batteries.  And especially ""fully automated driving"".

Someone needs to sit Cathy Woods down and explain to her how software  technology inexorably becomes very close to free.  What doesn't are things like health care, education, etc.",ahminus,16,1678312961.0

11m5n00,Options Calculator Suggestions?,"Good Afternoon,

I use the Options Calculator located here:[https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)

It's quite good for helping me visualize potential gains/losses based on a hypothetical trade.

There is one stock I've been trading for a while, my options strategy is okay but not great. I've made some money closing out some of my positions.

However, due to less than ideal liquidity on a stock i'm trading, i've had to close a lot of my legs individually instead of the whole trade.

I'm now stuck with a variety of calls / puts both bought and sold for the next six months.According to Options Calculator, there is no price at which these remaining options (taken together) can turn a profit.

What i'm looking for is perhaps  a calculator that will suggest a potential option (buy or sell) that can reduce the risk on this chart based on my inputs.  I've tried lots of options manually and some do better than others, but it's not efficient.

Here's a chart for if I do nothing:

**TL;DR** \- *Huge* surge in purchases this week, primarily driven by insider buying in the Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels industry.

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **February 27th - March 3rd.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of ‚ÄúP‚Äù or ‚ÄúS‚Äù. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **February 20th - February 24th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker**
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

Long Term, Tesla is still headed to a $2T market cap. 

6million vehicles per year x $12K margin per vehicle = $72Billion

$72 Billion with a reasonable PE ratio of 30 is over $2Trillion.

Reuters says Tesla is already at $15K margins on their vehicles. 

""Tesla earned $***15,653*** in gross profit per vehicle in the third quarter of 2022 - more than twice as much as Volkswagen AG (VOWG\_p.DE), four times...""

&#x200B;

This is **ignoring**  energy sector, solar, subscription services, FSD, robotaxi nonsense, etc.

Tesla will probably hit 6million cars per year in 2027.  

&#x200B;

Yes, Elon has lost his mind and has gone full MagaNazi. But him being an asshat aside, even a conservative look at the numbers has a $2T market cap. Margins may go up, then come down a bit per car. But they are already higher than needed for the above calculation. 

6 million per year is reasonable and lot less than the 20million per year that Tesla batted around as the goal for 2030. Even if it takes them until 2028 to hit 6million per year, or later, they will hit 6 million.

A PE ratio of 30 is reasonable.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%. (Stats as of 2023-02-28)",hardyrekshin,34,1678247226.0

Now if you remember from my TA last night this has all played out from a supply/ demand standpoint beautifully! 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/49tvj0hfzdma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1e227c5f35d99863cbc305645719c29ad1d9849d

**L**ets review what JPOW had to say today‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/myi3qzxfzdma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c3fa4c6a2a27f7c6437f9e79d42da6c0f31b0c77

Now lets take at the 50bps rate hike change‚Ä¶ from a 32% chance at open to 69% chance as of 325pm today‚Ä¶ 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kaxbgpbgzdma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c26ad43456b5676aca178b69444bb1cba282df88

So what does this mean? 

I see two real scenarios that are about to happen in the markets‚Ä¶ 

First scenario is that SPY is going to drop into CPI (next Tuesday the 14th) most likely targeting 390 support test -> CPI comes in good (better than expected) -> market absolutely rallies into FOMC. (most probable).

The second scenario is that markets realize they over reacted and we base/ hold 400+ into CPI -> CPI beats -> rally into FOMC. 

I am bullish on CPI and I think that it is going to show that a 50bps is not warranted yet. I believe what is happening is that the market is setting us up for a MASSIVE green CPI day. I am still waiting for official CPI consensus but as of now it looks really good for a beat (bullish). That CPI beat is going to dump the probability of a 50bps a lot and we are going to see a massive rally.   
 

FOMC when they confirm 25bps will be well received, however, the dot plot coming out is going to be nasty and markets much like December are going to dump heavily. 

&#x200B;

As you can see we still have a DOOZY of data the rest of the week‚Ä¶ I expect some 1% +/- opens over the next few days depending on what data does‚Ä¶ going to be a real volatile week as we head into CPI next week. 

**SPY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cdu2c9dhzdma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=14bea0571bb60447ed699d6322b94b4c183048cf

Today played out absolutely beautifully. We have that perfect evening doji star pattern that as I suspected would establish a new supply at 405.2. We not have a new supply put in short of the previous supplies (resistance) at 414-417. With this new resistance/ supply put in here we should look to take out lower supply at 396.46 before we push higher.

As I said before we do not want to leave a supply down below before we push higher. 

IF this sell off continues tomorrow if we reach that 394.7 to 396.5 range tomorrow we are going to come into some pretty hefty support. However, if we happen to lose 394.7 demand (support) tomorrow or really any day this week) then that would 100% set us up for a push lower back to 388.52 demand (support) that I was targeting before last weeks $12 rally. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mpbfs6uhzdma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ba559e8f9d737ba99d1743e4919ed9c10a1bd840

Taking a look at SPY daily here you can see we are still in this bigger blue breakout triangle here. With this new supply (resistance) being established today it perfectly correlates with our 405.3 channel resistance that has been a long standing pivot level on SPY. 

I frustratingly but conservatively did not take that 31dte put swing overnight. However, the risk of this going the other way today was there. 

Taking a look at the daily here the biggest thing to note is that we have no closed back below the daily 8, 20, 50 and 200ema. The last support remains at the 100ema which is hovering just over that 396.4 supply I mentioned before that was a target. The 100ema sits at 397 for tomorrow. 

Tomorrow we have data before market open and we have JOLTS at 10am (data) when JPOW once again will start testifying to congress. There is a lot of unknown. On one hand what possibly could jpow say tomorrow or be asked tomorrow that could actually reverse this or make it sell of further? Not much in my opinion. 

The biggest bear case is that the markets have not (with only one day) fully priced in a 50bps hike. So some more downside should be warranted. The other oddity is that for how reactive SPY was to that drop today the VIX was very underwhelming. Which shows people don‚Äôt fully believe it yet‚Ä¶ 

I think as the data comes in this week with more big data Thursday and Friday we will have a very volatile EOW. I don‚Äôt think going long here is worth it for puts or calls. I do favor 390 before we retest 405 again, however, with so much data and JPOW anyone predicting this is just guessing.   
 

I still remain under the consensus that regardless of what happens before CPI‚Ä¶ that CPI print (unless consensus comes in hot af compared to Bloomberg/ Cleveland fed) will be very bullish and when markets (algos) see that the CPI DID come down and that its IS lowering compared to last CPI/ CORE YoY that the chances of a 50bps hike are gonna dump for whatever they are at back to non-existent. 

While there is always a chance that JPOW drops a 50bps bomb on the market‚Ä¶ in all reality the chances of it is very slim. While inflation is not going to go straight to 2% easily and it will rebound (meaning YoY will come in OVER previous YoY) but I do not think it is going to be this CPI print as of now. 

However, when the FOMC meetings DOT PLOT comes out on March 22nd that is going to be very spicy‚Ä¶

SPY Levels:

Supply- 405.17 -> 396.46 -> 383.82  
 Demand- 394.68 -> 388.52  
 Daily Support- 398.2 -> 396.4 -> 394.6 -> 392.6  
 Daily Resistance- 399.6 -> 401.5 -> 404.5

**FUTURES SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7irg8vgizdma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=093c3ade3f0db3c0c8a4fda447aae6e59be94eeb

Futures had a beautiful pattern today too with supply/ demand playing out perfectly. As I had mentioned we were looking for that 4055 new supply (resistance) to be established and we officially got that today. Not only that though we came down perfectly to take out previous 4015 and 3991 supplies from the last 2 weeks. 

With 3991 and 4015 out of the weigh this opens up a push lower to 3960 and 3920 demand. My ultimate target for downside remains 3920. However, if we get a bounce tomorrow and markets decide to rally into CPI then I would be looking for 4096. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yq94k95jzdma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=16f60ae3f60b2f4729cf63e7e4d7af17c4c69575

Taking a look at the daily chart here on futures we are just chopping inside of this red channel that stretches from 3920 to 4095. 

With a breakdown last week to 3925 -> recovery to 4082 yesterday -> pattern would suggest a breakdown to minimally 3920. This would be a classic 123 rollercoaster as I have talked about so many times. 

Futures today unlike spy closed below its daily 8, 20, 50, 100 and 200ema. However, it is currently sitting directly on the 100ema. We did bounce direction off the support from Friday at 3983 today too. There is always a scenario where we get a massive double bottom after a drop like this. 

If we were to backtest resistance my targets would be 4020 and 4055. 

Futures levels:

Supply- 4054 -> 4160  
 Demand- 3960 -> 3920  
 Daily support- 3990 -> 3983 -> 3955 -> 3945 -> 3920  
 Daily resistance- 4020 -> 4053

Overall despite today being a highly volatile fed day and that massive $4 dump instantly at 10am I had a pretty good day trading. 

I unfortunately found myself in one of my level to level calls. I did not know jpow had a pre-released statement or I would have exited my calls before 10am. I did not expect a -$4 candle but it is what it is. Got a terrible fill on my stop loss too.   
   
 

Outside of that was a pretty great day of trading. I did take some long puts (30dte) in the morning and set a 10% stop loss and was a victim of that rogue $2 green candle at 1215pm. I am pretty bitter about that as I went longer dte on purpose and I would have ended up with a nice 15-20% win. It is what it is but that is my only gripe from today.

11l1ui8,Fed Chair Powell says interest rates are ‚Äòlikely to be higher‚Äô than previously anticipated,"* Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday cautioned that interest rates are likely to head higher than central bank policymakers had expected.
* ‚ÄúIf the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,‚Äù the central bank leader said in prepared remarks for appearances this week on Capitol Hill.
* Powell said the current trend shows that the Fed‚Äôs inflation-fighting job is not over.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday cautioned that interest rates are likely to head higher than central bank policymakers had expected.

Citing earlier data this year showing that inflation has reversed the deceleration it showed in late 2022, the central bank leader warned of tighter monetary policy ahead.

‚ÄúThe latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,‚Äù Powell said in remarks prepared for two appearances this week on Capitol Hill. ‚ÄúIf the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.‚Äù

Those remarks carry two implications: One, that the peak, or terminal, level of the federal funds rate is likely to be higher than the previous indication from the Fed officials, and, two, that the switch last month to a smaller quarter percentage point increase could be short-lived of inflation data continue to run hot.

In their December estimate, officials pegged the terminal rate at 5.1%. Current market pricing is a bit higher than that, in the 5.25%-5.5% areas, according to CME Group data. Powell did not specify how high he thinks rates ultimately will go.

The speech comes with markets generally optimistic that the Fed can tame inflation without running the economy into a ditch.

However, January data show that inflation as gauged by personal consumption expenditures prices ‚Äî the preferred metric for policymakers ‚Äî was still running at a 5.4% pace annually. That‚Äôs well above the Fed‚Äôs 2% long-run target and a shade above the December level.

Powell said the current trend shows that the Fed‚Äôs inflation-fighting job is not over.

‚ÄúWe have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do,‚Äù he said.

The Fed has raised its benchmark fund rate eight times over the past year to its current targeted level between 4.5%-4.75%. On its face, the funds rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending. But it feeds through to a multitude of other consumer debt products such as mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.

In recent says, some officials, such as Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, have indicated that they see the rate hikes coming to a close soon. However, others, including Governor Christopher Waller, have expressed concern about the recent inflation data and say tight policy is likely to stay in place.

‚ÄúRestoring price stability will likely require that we maintain a restrictive stance of monetary policy for some time,‚Äù Powell said. ‚ÄúThe historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done.‚Äù

Powell noted some progress on inflation for areas such as housing.

However, he also noted ‚Äúthere is little sign of disinflation‚Äù when it comes to the important category of services spending excluding housing, food and energy. That is an important qualifier considering that the chairman at his post-meeting news conference in early February said the disinflationary process had begun in the economy, remarks that helped send stocks higher.

Markets mostly expect the Fed to enact a second consecutive quarter point, or 25 basis points, rate increase at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting later this month. However, traders are pricing in close to a 30% probability of a higher half-point increase, according to CME Group data.

Powell reiterated that rate decisions will be made ‚Äúmeeting by meeting‚Äù and will be dependent on data and their impact on inflation and economic activity, rather than a pre-set course.

2. PCE Core services ex housing shows no disinflation at all.
3. Rents will show disinflation in the following months.
4. Stronger than expected economic data most likely will cause higher than expected rates.

Full text:

Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and other members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report.

My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation is causing significant hardship, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Over the past year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy. We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do. Our policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all.

I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.

Current Economic Situation and Outlook The data from January on employment, consumer spending, manufacturing production, and `inflation have partly reversed the softening trends that we had seen in the data just a month ago`. Some of this reversal likely reflects the unseasonably warm weather in January in much of the country. Still, the breadth of the reversal along with revisions to the previous quarter suggests that `inflationary pressures are running higher than expected at the time of our previous Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.`

From a broader perspective, inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year but remains well above the FOMC's longer-run objective of 2 percent. The 12-month change in total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices has slowed from its peak of 7 percent in June to 5.4 percent in January as energy prices have declined and supply chain bottlenecks have eased.

Over the past 12 months, core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, was 4.7 percent. As supply chain bottlenecks have eased and tighter policy has restrained demand, inflation in the core goods sector has fallen. `And while housing services inflation remains too high, the flattening out in rents evident in recently signed leases points to a deceleration in this component of inflation over the year ahead.`

That said, there is `little sign of disinflation thus far in the category of core services excluding housing`, which accounts for more than half of core consumer expenditures. To restore price stability, we will need to see lower inflation in this sector, and there will very likely be some softening in labor market conditions. Although nominal wage gains have slowed somewhat in recent months, they remain above what is consistent with 2 percent inflation and current trends in productivity. Strong wage growth is good for workers but only if it is not eroded by inflation.

Turning to growth, the U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real gross domestic product rising at a below-trend pace of 0.9 percent. Although consumer spending appears to be expanding at a solid pace this quarter, other recent indicators point to subdued growth of spending and production. Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.

Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight. The unemployment rate was 3.4 percent in January, its lowest level since 1969. Job gains remained very strong in January, while the supply of labor has continued to lag.1 As of the end of December, there were 1.9 job openings for each unemployed individual, close to the all-time peak recorded last March, while unemployment insurance claims have remained near historical lows.

Monetary Policy With inflation well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent and with the labor market remaining extremely tight, the FOMC has continued to tighten the stance of monetary policy, raising interest rates by 4-1/2 percentage points over the past year. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.2

We are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, the Committee slowed the pace of interest rate increases over its past two meetings. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.

`Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy. As I mentioned, the latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated.` If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes. Restoring price stability will likely require that we maintain a restrictive stance of monetary policy for some time.

Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done.

To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.

Thank you. I am happy to take your questions.

11l151f,The Fed‚Äôs Powell Speaks to Congress Today. Inflation and the Debt Ceiling Are in Focus.,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will make his semiannual visit to Capitol Hill this week, testifying before both the Senate and the House of Representatives as the central bank battles inflation and navigates the most aggressive pace of monetary-policy tightening in decades.

Powell‚Äôs back-to-back congressional appearances Tuesday and Wednesday follow the bank‚Äôs release last week of its Monetary Policy Report, which it submits to Congress twice a year.

While the hearings are nominally focused on the path forward for monetary policy, lawmakers are likely to question Powell on a broad range of subjects, from the rate-hike path and the economic outlook to debt-ceiling matters, regulatory issues, and the idea of a central-bank digital currency.

Given current economic volatility, and concerns about a potential recession, Powell is likely to be asked by both Republicans and Democrats how the Fed will navigate its dual mandate, which requires it to balance price stability with full employment. Steven Pavlick, head of policy with Renaissance Macro, says he sees an ‚Äúimportant debate‚Äù playing out about the two during the hearing.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have Republicans pushing for Powell to emphasize the price stability \[side\] to still get inflation down to its 2% target,‚Äù Pavlick said on his firm‚Äôs podcast on Monday. ‚ÄúThe Democrats we see emphasizing more of the employment side of the mandate and looking to maybe politically pressure Powell to slow the pace of further increases.‚Äù

The hearings come at a pivotal time for monetary policy. The Fed raised interest rates eight times over the past year, and is on track to continue tightening policy at its next meeting in two weeks. So far, its actions have had less of an impact on inflation than most economists expected: The consumer price index is up 6.4% year-over-year, and unemployment is at a remarkably low 3.4%.

The question now is whether and when the Fed should pause its tightening efforts. Some economists and lawmakers are growing concerned that the cumulative impact of the Fed‚Äôs actions has yet to fully trickle down through the economy, and that further rate hikes could go too far, thereby causing a recession. Stopping too soon, however, could allow inflation to become more entrenched in the economy and therefore harder to bring down.

Powell is also likely to face questions about the Congressional debate over lifting the government‚Äôs debt ceiling. The U.S. reached its borrowing limit in January, meaning Congress will be forced to act to raise the country‚Äôs debt limit‚Äîa move akin to raising the spending limit on a consumer credit card‚Äîbefore this summer, or risk a government default.

In the past, Powell has sought to keep the Fed out of the highly political debate over the debt ceiling while warning that failing to act would carry dire economic consequences.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one way forward here, and that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States government can pay all of its obligations when due,‚Äù Powell said in February, adding that ‚Äúany deviations from that path would be highly risky and that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the consequences of failing to act in a timely manner.‚Äù

11l0op9,0DTE options could turn 5% intraday market decline into 25% rout -JPMorgan,"Trading in new near-dated U.S. options contracts can supercharge volatility in U.S. stocks, potentially leading to tremendous intraday declines, analysts at JPMorgan said. 

The U.S. equity options market has seen a rise in the trading of options contracts set to expire at the end of the trading day - dubbed 0DTE (zero day to expiry) options - with their daily notional value rising to about **$1 trillion**, according to JPMorgan data. 

 Their **recent growth** has been eyed as one cause of intraday volatility, with JPMorgan's Marko Kolanovic last month warning they could spark a massive volatility event under certain circumstances. 

 In a Monday note, the bank‚Äôs analysts attempted to further quantify the derivatives‚Äô potential impact, estimating that in an extremely dire scenario, 0DTE options could turn an intraday 5% drop in the S&P 500 **(.SPX)** into a 25% rout - a magnitude of decline not seen since the Black Monday crash of 1987, when the index fell 20.5%. 

Such a scenario could occur if the S&P 500 fell 5% in five minutes, triggering $30.5 billion in 0DTE option-related trading that would tack another 20 percentage points onto the index's decline, the bank‚Äôs analysts said.

If the S&P 500 fell between 1% and 5% in five minutes, it could lead to an unwinding of positions in the range of $6.6 billion to $14.2 billion, translating to an additional 4 to 8.1 percentage points of decline, JP Morgan's analysts said.

 ""The estimated market impacts from unwinding of 0D option exceed the original market shocks in all scenarios, highlighting the reflexive nature of the 0D options and their potential risk posed to market stability,"" JPM analysts Peng Cheng and Emma Wu wrote in a note.

Furthermore, JPM noted that retail traders were not the main driver of volume growth in 0DTE options, with individual investors accounting for about 20% of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust **(SPY.P)** options volume and only around 5% of the S&P 500 same-day options.

11ko3kx,Shorting VIX investment idea - Tell me what y'all think," 

SVIX is a relatively new ETF established in late March last year, it shorts volatility using futures similarly to SVXY. For any veteran volatility shorting enjoyers, you‚Äôll remember the 3-10% monthly returns SVXY had from 2016-2018 until its collapse after a spike in volatility and small market selloff during early 2018. This led to a \~90% decline in value of the ETF and many ruined portfolios. Nevertheless, this new ETF, SVIX, is quite promising as the volatility trends of the past 2 years have been relatively predictable with a bottom VIX of about \~18-20 dollars then rising to 35 in periodic volatility spikes. However, these trends as of the last few months have declined along with a decline in market volatility. Overall, I believe that an investment strategy revolving around both investment in and shorting of SVIX to profit off of moves in volatility but I wanted to check here to see if this is a viable investment strategy. As I am aware, strategies work until they don‚Äôt, but the medium term outlook of this strategy will be a decent hedge against too much volatility. On top of that, because investors won‚Äôt be directly holding futures contracts it gives them more flexibility and liquidity. 

\*\*SVIX will be used as its gains are amplified in comparison to the older ETF, SVXY.

Investment Strategy:

Short the SVIX at the VIX price of 16-19 dollars, as this would allow you to directly track the VIX itself as a short of a short is normal. 

Then as market volatility tops off buy normal shares of SVIX and sell when it goes below 20 in optimal conditions but given more spikes in volatility sell off earlier.

For context, the collapse in SVXY took \~1-2 months for it to lose 90% of its value, which is not an insignificant amount of time. If another market selloff/spike in volatility occurs, an adept investor would be able to course correct/sell off. 

Returns:

Moves in volatility are equal to ability to earn, so if volatility fluctuates greatly between a predictable range (This has been proven to happen in back tests of VIX prices) this is a great opportunity to profit off of the VIX price using SVIX.

Depending on the volatility of the options market, general macroeconomic conditions, and the insight of the investor, monthly returns could average 5-10% for a peak annual return of 40-50% if conditions are good and timing is optimal. I know these numbers are insane but its for optimal performance, but honestly if you want to check just back test investments comparing the VIX alongside SVIX.   
Disclaimer: This does rely on timing of the market which is not good at all, as historically time in the market does beat timing the market however this strategy is relatively straightforward, granted you have knowledge of the function of the options market and general volatility in macroeconomic trends.",NikoBrooks,8,1678160636.0

11knpf0,Robinhood Stock Lending Experience,"TLDR: How much can you make? About 0.1%. Not 1% -- 0.1% annually. Almost nothing.

I'm sharing my experience with Robinhood Stock Lending because it was very hard to find information online about how much you can make.

Robinhood states, ""... stocks with low market availability and high demand are more likely to be borrowed.""

I owned about 600 shares of a low volume stock that had a short squeeze in the month of February. It went up about 50% and had 50x more than the average volume on many of those days. Thus, I think the month of February encapsulates what would probably be the best month to loan out my stock.

Throughout February, I owned about $10k to $16k, with all shares loaned out for every day of February.

From February, I earned a whopping $1 and 36 cents (just to be clear). That's approx, conservatively a 0.16% annual rate.

So, this is nothing (at least with the amount of stock I own). And the question becomes, is it worth it for my stock to be loaned out to short sellers who are going to manipulate the stock I believe in and also apply downward price pressure? For me, that's not worth it, and I turned off stock lending.

According to Robinhood, they determine how much you make by ""a rebate rate that is 15% of the weighted average rebate rate we earned by lending that stock to borrowers on that day."" Per my understanding, this means they loaned it out with about 2.4% interest, which makes sense.

But, @ Robinhood, that's way too low. It's our money/property after all. Want us to take the risk that you default (which, check notes, [almost happened](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/27/robinhood-report-meme-stock-gamestop/#:~:text=On%20the%20morning%20of%20January,of%20the%20NSCC's%20rules%20and)) and let stock/vote manipulators bet against our own companies? 15% is too low.Robinhood Stock Lending Experience

* SPY closed up 0.07%
* QQQ closed up 0.11%
* Dow Jones Industrial closed up 0.12%
* VIX closed up 0.76%

Good evening everyone, I hope you all had a nice start to the week. The major indices gapped up and rose quickly to intraday highs only to reverse and close slightly above Fridays close. Tomorrow and Wednesday Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will be speaking to congress in the ‚Äú*Semiannual Monetary Policy Report*‚Äú. This will offer insight into the Feds policy and may move the markets.

SPY traded briefly above the 21 day EMA (orange line) before reversing and closing below for the day. In hindsight this may have been expected as we were coming off of a large bounce on the 200 day EMA (white line). One positive is that this happened on lower than average volume, indicating a low conviction of sellers. Make no mistake this is still a sign for investors to be cautious, especially with the Fed Chair speaking for the next couple days.

We can see a similar story with QQQ. However, here there is slightly more volume than average but still less than yesterday. This chart is in no way screaming buying opportunity. Both indices are telling us to be cautious and that is what we need to do as investors. We cannot argue with price, we have to listen to what it is telling us.

**Potential Setups:**

First on the list is AIT, an industrial distribution company. AIT is forming a small base with a trigger price of $145.80. Revenue is up 20.92% quarter over quarter and EPS is up 40.64% year over year. This stock is in a defensive sector, meaning if the generally market begins to fall this may trigger. This could also trigger depending on what is discussed in the monetary report.

ANET is a computer hardware company that is setting up with a long base breakout. This base goes back to March of 2022. It was tested recently after earnings but retreated and is now close again. ANET has a trigger price of $144.80. We are watching this stock because it has a 54.71% increase in revenue and a 79.28% increase in EPS year over year.

CMI is an industrial machinery manufacturer with a small daily base forming. CMI has seen a revenue increase of 32.82% and an EPS increase of 61.97% year over year. This stock could also be classified into the defensive sector and may be able to make price advances even if the general market is declining.

CXM is a software application company and appears to be forming a cup with a handle. This looks to be a constructive setup because price increased on volume and then, for the most part, traded sideways and lower volume. The trigger point for this setup is $11.30, this is approximately 3% away and may be a bit to extended if price attempts to get there tomorrow. If price gets there tomorrow it would need to have heavy volume pushing through the trigger to still be considered.

Lastly, we have RMBS, a semiconductor company. Since last year, RMBS has had several nice upwards moves and has nearly doubled in price. It may appear that the stock is very extended but many continue to break into new all time highs, especially if we are at the begining of a bull market. Revenue has increased 33.32% and EPS has increased 165.12% year over year. There is also 3.7 days of short interest that may help push price higher if the shorts are forced to cover. This is a small base breakout so it is inherently riskier. The trigger price is $45.60.

**Bringing everything together:**

The watchlist of stocks tonight is small give the pullback seen in the major indices today. The next few days may be quiet as investors wait to see what Jerome Powell will say in his speeches to congress. If any of these setups trigger it would be wise to take a small position as the markets can still be easily swayed. Overall, be cautious yet open to new opportunities when they present themselves.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.

For those of you that don‚Äôt know JPOW testifies to congress tomorrow and Wednesday. This is a yearly thing that he has done since at least 2021. 

In 2021 we saw a red day, however, in 2022 we saw a pretty big green day putting in nearly 2%... the question we have to ask is‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwill markets listen to jpow and interrupt what he is saying as hawkish finally? Or is this going to be like the last 3-4 times he spoke where the markets had blinders on?‚Äù  
 

Based on the last 2 weeks of downtrend (outside of Thursday and Friday) I honestly think markets (and more importantly the algos) are more ready to accept a hawkish JPOW and are more ready to sell off depending on what he says. 

**SPY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/si3wu0ylu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6ab668ddf7ff2144e42753f313ee8fa3f0f6ce79

Taking a look at supply and demand here on SPY daily if you remember I said one of the more short term bullish but longer term bearish scenarios was that SPY would come up and take out 405.74 demand from 2/10. We did just that today. Now what is important is what happens next. With this evening doji star pattern here and the techicals pointing to a new supply being established soon‚Ä¶ IF spy closes below todays low there is a very good chance we are going to see this 405.74 demand turned into supply. Turning a demand into supply (resistance) is extremely bearish and would cement not only this level but would also cement a lower supply than the previous ones up in that 414-417 area. 

All eyes remain on tomorrows close to see what that technical show. If we establish this 405.2 as supply tomorrow then my ultimate target realistically is 396.5 supply from 2/24. If we can take that supply (currently support) out and turn it into a new demand or reconfirm previous demand (support) at 394.88 that would be very bullish going forward. I would 1000% play a bounce from that 395/396 area back to 405. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACITON**

Looking at the daily chart here everything is screaming put here. This evening doji star pattern is one of the highest probability setups for a put. If it wasn‚Äôt for jpow speaking tomorrow and Wednesday and my overall lack of trust in this market and the fact that pre markets have seen some incredibly volatile overnight swings‚Ä¶ I would 1000% be in at least a 14-30dte put. I fully expect the 400 support area (which is the daily 200ema) to be retested this week when we see a structure like this. 

SPY:

Supply- 396.46 -> 414.13  
 Demand- 394.68 -> 388.52  
 Daily Support- 404.4 -> 399.7 -> 397.8  
 Daily Resistance- 405.3 -> 407.2 -> 408.2

**FUTURES SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kghecwxmu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c8640f69408460d40fc5c31b037600d283305992

Now if you remember on futures last week we had taken out previous demand and now we are officially in a no mans land. We either need to find the extra strength to push to 4096 before we establish a new supply (resistance) short of that. OR we need to establish a new supply (resistance) and come take out lower supply at 4015/ 3991.

For me personally based on the technical and daily price action we should turn todays candle into a supply (resistance) here at 4055. Doing so will then open up a retrace to ‚Äútake out‚Äù previous supplies at 4015 and 3990. IF we take those out and can establish a new demand before retesting 3960 then I would like a push back to 4096. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qcfyqydnu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=82c9045d96792ed6ddcd70116dab96d8101a62e1

taking a look at futures daily price action here are one could imagine the candles are similar to spy (which isn‚Äôt always the case) and we are actually seeing a pretty significant reversal candle set up here too. With the SPY and Futures daily reversal set ups I would be surprised to not see a retrace to minimally 4020 tomorrow. 4020 is currently where the daily 8, 50 and 200ema sit. However, there is a chance with JPOW speaking tomorrow that the algos could do something funky which obviously would result in a breaking of technical. 

Again if it wasn‚Äôt for JPOW I would have felt pretty darn comfortable in overnight 25-30dte puts. But little reason to take the risk. 

Futures: 

Supply- 3990 -> 4015 -> 4160  
 Demand- 3920 -> 3960 -> 4096  
 Daily support- 4050 -> 3983  
 Daily resistance- 4085 -> 4095 -> 4113

**VIX**

Overall the VIX is still in a down trend here as you can see. However, it put in a really nice inside day today. Historically speaking inside days result in continuation but is not always the case. 

I mentioned on Friday that the 18.2 support touch on Friday should have resulted in a VIX bounce which is clearly did. However, that apparently did not account for the fact that SPY wouldn‚Äôt care that the VIX was green all day long too‚Ä¶ nor would it account for the fact that yields once again were elevated again while SPY was green. 

The only thing that played correctly was that DXY was down just slightly today while SPY was green.

Absolutely a great way to start off the week! No complaints at all. I got burnt as you can see twice in calls though. The first one I stopped myself out of when we were playing around that 406.5 to 407.3 morning/ mid day chop‚Ä¶ I entered a call on support (what I thought was) and price action broke a key level. I took my exit and then of course it pushed to HOD. Tough bounce but was the right play and the right stop loss. 

Only other loss today was a stop out when we  bounced off support and once again had a fake break down.

The morning was extremely frustrating to trade as we were seeing that VOLD was extremely bearish along with the VIX and the yields, however, SPY continued to push up. Made for some choppy trading. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p7qhh2npu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2425feb7b9e7181bf8ca9e5ec81648a6beab44ad

However, the best play of the day was the 1225am retest of 407.3 resistance. I saw it as a short opportunity and took a beautiful 9.4% win. I ended up closing for profits when we came back down and were holding 405.3 support at 1pm. I actually was looking for a bigger recovery back up to 407 again. However, EOD actually ended up being fairly bearish. 

I am bearish to neutral. If bulls take back 405.3 tomorrow then I would be bullish until we touch 4096 supply. However, I feel fairly confident unless jpow pumps us tomorrow that we establish a new supply and will push back to that 3990/4015 area this week.

After reading that post about ""Freeport never, ever going down again"" I decided to post some of my own research. Like sure, we're all a lil' regarded, but to say that a facility that literally went kaboom will never go down again is just not really DD. So here's what I found and are my thoughts on Natty-G.

First thing before I get into the actual fundamentals is that the AUM for BOIL is off the charts, which is causing issues for the dudes running it. There are position limits on the exchange, so they are having to go to banks to get swaps to keep up with the fund interest. What does that mean? For the longest time, BOIL just tracked NG 2x, but now with such massive interest, BOIL is actually influencing the underlying contracts higher. Every day they have to go out and buy 2x the lots to make sure they aren't left holding the bag when we eventually take our own out. And I mean like hell yeah, bullish $BOIL right? But what happens when the fund has to roll? This ain't what happened in 2021, like yes you can stop out shorts, but we're talking about an actual commodity that isn't just influenced by us, it responds to actual market prices, and those prices say lower. This ain't us vs. some fund, it's us vs. everyone in the US who uses natural gas, which btw is literally everyone.

And they have to sell out and buy the next month because the contracts are for a physical commodity that is bound by month, aka if they don't sell they have to take delivery of a lotttt of actual cow farts in Louisiana. When they sell that many lots in such a short time, it ain't gonna be good. If today's price of NG tanks, the price of summer gas has to tank too because if it didn't, everyone would just buy cheap gas now, put it in storage, and just sell it in the summer. So the summer contracts will drop too. It hasn't been a problem in past months because BOIL wasn't such a large part of the market, but now, dumping that many contracts right before they expire is going to influence the whole futures market past this month (which is the largest part of their position), and that influence ain't gonna be up. Yes, they will use those funds to buy the next month and push it up, but again, we don't have the power here like we did with that retailer; the physical market will eventually tank price this summer in the face of every $BOIL position as we've already started to see today.

[https:\/\/ycharts.com\/companies\/BOIL\/total\_assets\_under\_management](https://preview.redd.it/bfef2sqm05ma1.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0508d0aced725b66994c01b7e9a9be0ce885ee81)

Ok on fundamentals, I believe that the BOIL run is basically done, had a nice little uptick Friday. But, many of y'all have been taking profit (see the far right of the chart above where total assets are dropping, so so much for hodling smh although after the rally on Friday y'all bought more, buy high sell low right?), and the final cold weather before next winter is about to hit. This means we're going to turn to injecting the gas into the ground and changing to summer pricing. What does that look like? Well, what do you do when supply is ""10"" and demand is ""8""? You store ""2"" in the ground to use in the winter when supply is still ""10"" and demand is now ""12"". But guess what, that storage space has to be there... We are at the upper range of our natural gas storage coming out of a very warm winter, meaning that before this coming summer ends, we are going to be totally full (we are producing at a record pace and the earnings releases I looked at didn't say they plan on slowing down this year). Again, I ain't the sharpest spoon in the drawer, but I know that when supply is ""10"", demand is ""8"", and you don't have anything to put your ""2"" in, price jumps off a cliff. I can repeat the example with bananas instead of numbers if that's helpful, it helped me anyways.

Tesla stock has had a red-hot start to 2023 thanks to enormous retail investor interest, but Elon Musk's announcements this week could end up sparking a sell-off rather than more enthusiasm, according to Vanda Research.¬†

In a note following Musk's latest colorful statements at the company's investor day, Vanda forecasted that Tesla shares will see a decline in overall purchases in the near term.

Shares of the EV-maker declined 6% Thursday. So far this year, Tesla stock has gained more than 80% following 2022's brutal performance.

""\[Th\]e monthly purchases of TSLA by retail investors are off the chart, likely attributable to a combination of relatively low perceived price and excitement surrounding Musk's Master Plan,"" the strategists said.

Tesla (TSLA) has had a red-hot start to 2023 thanks to enormous retail investor interest ($14 billion in shares purchased), but Elon Musk's announcements last week could end up sparking a sell-off rather than more enthusiasm, per Vanda Research.

US stocks ended the week on a positive note as speculation about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes dominated investor sentiment. The S&P 500 saw a rally on Friday, breaking a three-week losing streak, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its best day since early February.

Despite a report showing the service sector's resilience, investors remained upbeat, betting that the impact of the Fed's hikes on the economy would be delayed. A measure of prices paid by service providers revealed that costs were rising at a slower rate, which helped buoy traders' spirits.

Although bond yields rose for the week, a Friday rally in treasuries caused the 10-year yield to hover around 3.96%. Meanwhile, the dollar index had its worst week since mid-January, following four weeks of gains.

Investors will be eagerly watching next week's non-farm payrolls report for clues on whether the economy can withstand further rate hikes. This week's data showed continued labor-market resilience in the United States, bolstering the case for the Fed to maintain its tightening policy, which pushed almost every major asset into the red in February.

However, traders were encouraged by Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic's remarks on Thursday that the central bank may pause rate hikes this summer. Although Bostic and his colleagues stressed that their decisions would remain data dependent, traders interpreted his comments as dovish. A Fed report released on Friday emphasized that further rate increases are on the way, but it appears that investors are feeling optimistic regardless.

# Market Risk Alert

At 16:15 ET, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin said that if inflation persists, the central bank may be able to raise interest rates further. This comment came after a statement earlier in the day where Barkin indicated that Fed policymakers anticipate more rate hikes and no rate cuts this year. The Fed has been closely monitoring inflation as it considers its policy options.

At 12:03 ET, a senior European Union official said that the US and EU are working toward an agreement in principle on a free trade agreement-like status. The two sides have been negotiating for some time, and this announcement is a sign of progress. A free trade agreement could have significant economic implications for both the US and the EU.

The Federal Reserve released a statement at 11:03 ET indicating that the labor force participation rate is likely to remain well below its level from before the pandemic. This could have important implications for the economy and policymakers, as a lower participation rate could indicate weaker labor market conditions.

At 09:48 ET, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said that reports about the United Arab Emirates considering leaving OPEC were ""far from the truth."" This came after several media outlets reported that the UAE was considering an exit from the oil-producing group. Meanwhile, the price of WTI crude oil strengthened amid ongoing concerns about global supply and demand dynamics.

# Market watchers eye 200 Moving Average backtest: How will prices react at 404.05-405.86

Investors are keeping a close eye on the 200-day moving average as a backtest approaches. The key focus is on how the price reacts around the 200 moving average or resistance zone, which is currently set at 404.05 - 405.86. This will help determine whether there are more sellers or buyers based on volume. In addition, there is the possibility of overshooting the 2022 downturned diagonal resistance at 407.50 - 410.01.

If the market experiences downside, bulls will be on the lookout for potential support at 399.66 - 397.82 while using 401.93 as a pivot. However, if the potential support is lost, bulls' last hope would be at 395.49.

## Expected Move Based on Patterns

*As noted, we are nearing the half measure to the upside.*

#### What is a rectangle pattern?

A rectangle is a technical pattern that occurs in trading when the price of an asset moves between horizontal support and resistance levels. This pattern suggests that there is no clear trend in the market as the price oscillates between these two levels. The rectangle pattern typically ends when there is a breakout, and the price moves beyond the support or resistance level.

Traders have different approaches to trading rectangles. Some traders prefer to trade within the rectangle, buying when the price is near the bottom of the range and selling or shorting when it reaches the top. Other traders prefer to wait for breakouts before taking action. They believe that trading breakouts can result in larger profits because the price tends to move significantly in the direction of the breakout. Ultimately, the approach a trader takes will depend on their individual trading strategy and risk tolerance.

# Wall Street sugar daddy who fell for Manhattan stripper sues

Story by Melissa Koenig For Mailonline ‚Ä¢ Yesterday 9:19 PM*373 Comments*

üì∑

AWall Street financier is suing a stripper after he leant her hundreds of thousands of dollars and a Gucci scarf when COVID shut down her club.

John Leahy, of Union, [Michigan](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/michigan/index.html), filed the suit against Aline Luz Dunga and her mother, Annalu Gomez, in Manhattan [Supreme Court](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/us-supreme-court/index.html) on February 24, alleging that they never paid him back the money he leant them over a three year span.

He claims in the suit that he fell for Aline Luz Dunga when he first met her at her job as an exotic dancer, and thought they were in a serious relationship as he spent $125,000 to help her through the global pandemic.

Leahy also claimed he once leant Dunga his Gucci scarf, which she never gave back, and helped pay her mother's [cancer](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/cancer/index.html) treatments and [Massachusetts](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/massachusetts/index.html) state taxes before they stopped speaking with him.

1. Massive 0DTE trading draws traders into the market - Q1 result gonna be lit.
2. RH offers the HIGHEST interest rate among everything I‚Äôm seeing. 4.15% now. Flexible, no strings attached, liquid. Of course you pay $5 a month, but seriously, it‚Äôs totally worth it. (Seriously don‚Äôt go to BofA, Chase and all that shit for your savings who provide 0.02% rate, go to robinhood, SoFi who actually passes gains onto customers).
3. Retirement account for non-corporate people, seriously an interesting business.
4. Tons of cash on the sideline to endure the coming economic downturn (23B assets, 16B debt, latest filing shows 6.23B in cash, short term interest alone generates $30 mil per year).
5. They have minimal exposure to crypto shitshow as they simply hold and transact customers‚Äô coins, they don‚Äôt invest the coins anywhere at all. They generate some revenue via flow (their fills are shit), but it‚Äôs near-0 risk.

&#x200B;

Bears, if you would like a nice little rub and tug, look no further. This post will explain why buying shares of leveraged volatility products cannot and will not go tits up.

I am down 37 bands since I last posted[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vj63p9/my_plan_for_intergenerational_wealth_uvxy_svxy/) 8 months ago. I haven't given up my thesis or my dollar cost averaging and I won‚Äôt until capitulation occurs, be it next year or next week. As I see it, the longer this equities bubble persists, the more time I have to build up my already quite large position. In this post I would like to discuss my perspective on: **Why the VIX is asleep, Hypothetical price targets for UVXY, and How my strategy has changed.**

Disclaimer: The 2x volatility index that I trade is below the $500mm market cap (or AUM in this case) allowed by WSB, so I will be focusing on UVXY for this post. Check my positions at the end of this post to see exactly what I am doing.

Another Disclaimer: I‚Äôm quite regarded. While my DD should be solid from a factual standpoint, only imitate my positions if you don‚Äôt mind the possibility of having a few extra inches added to the circumference of your anus.

Without Further ado.

**Why the VIX is Asleep**

As many of you may know, the VIX index is calculated using a very complex equation, but essentially is tracking the spread of options premiums on the SPX. In uncertain times or market downturns, as traders scramble for downside protection, these spreads can get sporadic and the VIX will spike.

So what gives? Why hasn‚Äôt there been a meaningful increase in the VIX index since the market has fallen \~20% last year? I mean, the VIX spiked over 150% with the Fed rate hikes in 2018 while the market dropped \~18% from September to December. Well the answer has to do with a worrying trend that has started getting out of hand in the past three quarters: institutional investors and hedge funds trading 0DTE options on the SPX. These types of trades create ample liquidity in the options market, rocketing the indices to new highs (remember when QQQ closed +7.35% on 11-10-22 ?) and suppressing the VIX index. This can lead to a vicious cycle with lower lows in the VIX begetting higher highs in the SPX, encouraging further 0DTE  gambling. But every cycle must come to an end‚Ä¶

[0DTE SPX volume at an all time high, while the VIX and VVIX make sharpest declines since Volmageddon](https://preview.redd.it/eassycii7sla1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=51dcdea114d3bee283968cec8b9b89bdb9bd0d44)

These types of trades generate large profits for the institutions who are able to sell far OTM options without posting collateral. However, as we all know, trading 0DTE comes with its risks. When the narrative regarding the economy changes (consumer debt is at all time highs, while household savings is nearing all time lows btw), or a large player in the 0DTE market leaves for whatever reason (drying up liquidity) hell will break loose. When the price stability in the options market goes haywire, VIX will spike. On top of this, scrambling for 0TE puts to hedge will drill the SPX as MMs need to sell SPX short to gamma hedge.

To conclude this section, trading 0DTE works very well‚Ä¶ until it doesn‚Äôt. Now onto the fun part: price targets.

**Price Targets**

First things first, this volatility spike will not be like Dec 2018. How can I be so sure? Well, because if it was, we would have seen it happen already. In early October 2018, the market reacted swiftly to Fed policy, with the VIX following closely behind.

[VIX reacts to market declines immediately in 2018](https://preview.redd.it/o0xiim3u7sla1.png?width=3785&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2b8960cae702ae056eb2b6da4769f1d31868beb3)

Compare this to what we see now. A sell off, comparable in percent decline, without the fireworks on the VIX:

[VIX stays calm despite 20&#37; drawdown](https://preview.redd.it/qlli2yfy7sla1.png?width=3767&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c25bdbd233a47be331dc7ef74efbe9856b338be9)

Okay, so VIX is dead, so what? Well I‚Äôd like to convince you that this is a premonition of something far more violent than the VIX spike in late 2018. I believe that this first 20% leg down was orderly selling by institutions, all of which are preparing for a monstrous capitulation in the coming year. I‚Äôd like to remind you that despite the fact that we are off of the all time highs of Jan 2022, we are still in a massive equities bubble that is only exacerbated by earnings contraction and the weakening consumer. Given that we are at the end of a 12 year secular bull run, I think it‚Äôs appropriate that we look at the behavior of the VIX in prior recessions.

**2001**

March 2000 to June 2001-- SPY: -22.7%, VIX: +40%

June 2001 to September 2002-- SPY: -38.1%, VIX: +113%

[VIX trades sideways until second leg sell-off](https://preview.redd.it/ybyjqrm28sla1.png?width=3781&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b205a5ed556446aa4d552df5013d6e0e29678e1)

**2008**

October 2007 to August 2008-- SPY: -16.7%, VIX: +3.3%

August 2008 to October 2008-- SPY: -24.8%, VIX: +419%

[VIX snoozes until MASSIVE spike during OCT '08 capitulation](https://preview.redd.it/nk2rnqq68sla1.png?width=3790&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=61d7edc7470c202d168b0ff18d02d0ab1efefc56)

It is apparent that when a big recession is brewing, the VIX will remain relatively tame during the first leg down, before exploding during the final capitulation. So what are my price targets for the coming capitulation?

**Price Targets**

I am going to use the historical prices of UVXY during the COVID crash to extrapolate what we may be able to expect from a leveraged volatility ETF during a full blown panic. I am aware that the COVID crash was a rather unique scenario, with the first pandemic in a century adding extra fear and volatility to the sell off on the way down. I am not here to argue about the exact price that VIX will reach, but given the recent 0DTE gambling, declining housing market, impending wars, persistent inflation, etc. I think it is reasonably realistic to use COVID crash as a model example (especially considering how much larger the bubble has gotten since 2020).

UVXY hit an intraday low of 105.5 on February 19, 2020. After a wild month of trading, UVXY topped out at 1350 on March 18, 2020. This astounding 1180% price increase is a testament to how extreme leveraged volatility ETFs can behave in uncertain times. But wait, UVXY is only a 1.5x leveraged VIX futures product. What if we wanted more leverage? Hypothetically, the 2x leveraged ETF that I own (that I shall not name) would return a staggering 1606%. This is like going from 16.18 (it‚Äôs closing price on Friday 3/3) to 276.06. Remember, this is just based on the COVID crash. Whether or not this next spike will come up short or surpass this return, no one can know. What I do know, is that your returns will likely be so significant that you cannot lose money buying shares of these products.

**WHY YOU CANNOT LOSE MONEY BUYING UVXY**

[A painful chart to look at](https://preview.redd.it/8ixiplob8sla1.png?width=2294&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bd8b848a17f2dfba201cd2d69cfb4f409213996a)

UVXY decays, we know. We also know that the return needed to break even on a losing trade becomes more and more daunting as your percent loss increases. For the sake of this DD or (perhaps more accurately) hardcore bear porn, please indulge with me. Imagine that on Monday a crash similar to COVID crash begins, it won‚Äôt, but just imagine. What does this mean? It means that over the next month, UVXY will go from 4.57 to 58.48, an 1180% return. Wow! If you bought on Friday at close, that's a great return! But let‚Äôs be real, that would never happen. We all know that timing the market is extraordinarily difficult. This is the number one reason I quit options. Suppose you still wanted to capture some of the return from that incredible spike in UVXY. Well, what if you dollar cost averaged? I can already hear the replies, ‚ÄúDCA in UVXY?!?!?! What a regard‚Äù and on and on. Well I think this strategy may have more merit than you give it credit for. Why? Two reasons: dollar cost averaging allows you to build up a massive position in UVXY (or another volatility product) while not having to time the crash. Sounds like a win-win.

Now, consider the chart I posted above. Consider that in order to break even on this hypothetical UVXY spike you would have had to buy UVXY and then sustain a 92% loss.

12.80x = 1

x= 0.078

1-x = 0.92 = 92%

Do you understand what this means?? It means that to lose money on this trade you would have to own shares of UVXY at an average share price of 58.49 or greater. A price not seen since May 2021! Jeez even I‚Äôm not \*that\* early on the trade. What‚Äôs more, is that you would have had to buy at that price and not have accumulated any more shares. If you so much as bought any shares after that date, you would be in the green due to a lower cost basis.

Now yes, this math works for the COVID crash scenario. Okay, well lets say UVXY only spikes a measly 800%. To break even you would need to buy at an 89% loss. That‚Äôs like buying UVXY at 41.13‚Ä¶ again, in May 2021.

Reference the chart above for other scenarios, but I think you get the picture. Keep this in mind as you consider the percent drawdown in my positions (aka unrealized loss porn) below. Know that my cost basis decreases weekly.

**TO CONCLUDE**

The 4 phase plan is the same as it‚Äôs been with a minor change. I will:

1. DCA into a volatility product until capitulation
2. Put earnings into SVXY or similar index and ride the volatility back down
3. **Put money into QQQ** (instead of SPY) with as much margin as I can get
4. Wait for the real estate market to bottom and buy a house

And the most damning evidence that this trade will work:

In addition to that, while relatively new to investing compared to some, this month has been unprecedentedly volatile following a rally some would believe to be too hopeful. 

I had taken a break from investing/gambling until I saw the bubble forming in January and re-entering in mid February to short what I believed overbought and made some cash and reinvested into long OTM VIX calls and long OTM SPY puts preparing for the collapse I kept hearing about. After doing more research it seems that date might come later than expecting given the FED‚Äôs continuation to take little action amid rising inflation and continuous pivoting. It‚Äôs hard to believe the comment from Bolstic out of nowhere Thursday upon hitting the 200 Day MA wasn‚Äôt orchestrated to rebound instead of falling through support. My question is why. If we are going down, why not tank it now and let it rebuild sooner instead of continue this volatility?

11huwl3,"$ABML has $1.2 Trillion lithium ü§ØTonopah Flats property in Nevada one of largest lithium deposits in US, company says","Hello there, 

I‚Äôm gonna try keep this short and sweet for all you highly regarded folk. There‚Äôs a lithium mining/battery recycling stock going by the ticker $ABML, which just recently hit the $500 million market cap ($547 million to be precise) meaning the stock can now be spoken about on WSB. 

I may be a little special and I‚Äôm quite baked rn but I‚Äôm going to try lay out for why I think this stock is a potential 10X stock and why you don‚Äôt want to miss this opportunity. 

Firstly, the stock is currently up 78% over the last 3 months, largely as a result of its mining flats in Tonopah being assessed by a third party to contain upwards of 15 million tonnes of Lithium. That‚Äôs the largest supply of Lithium in the entirety of the USA! A country, which until now has been struggling to source and have any real security of its own affordable battery metals. I believe the Biden administration has been looking into ways to sure up America‚Äôs battery metal supply chains, as importing it is costly and relying on other countries isn‚Äôt for Uncle Sam. $ABML may have just stumbled upon the answer and if they have the stock is about to go parabolic.

You know that shit Daddy Musk and every other car company puts in his car batteries? The shit that currently costs more than gold at $70k per tonne‚Ä¶ This company has basically found itself with lithium deposits that are the same weight as 128k fat Jonah Hills. That‚Äôs pretty fucking fat.
So back of the napkin math 15 million tonnes X $70k = $1.25 trillion. That‚Äôs right $1,250,000,000! 

And the best part? $ABML controls 100% of the mining lode claims in the Tonopah flats and the subsurface minerals without any royalties. 
The company also plans to expand the area to the north and south of the property and explore to greater depths. 
90% of the 15 million tonnes is easily recoverable.
And if that‚Äôs not perfect enough, their factory is only 25 miles away from the Tesla gigafactory! 

Secondly, this is a company I‚Äôve been following for years, and it‚Äôs fair to say management hasn‚Äôt always been the best. The company is currently down 75% from it‚Äôs ATH of $4 per share, attributable to the slow progress they have made up till now. However, this company is now run by their fairly newly appointed CEO Ryan Melsert, an ex-Tesla employee who realised the importance (and financial benefits) of securing America‚Äôs battery metals supply chain. The guy is an absolute genius, the company has won countless awards and government grants for its unique, patented and environmentally-friendly way of recycling battery metals. 

The whole point of switching to electric cars is to reduce carbon emissions and damage to the environment. This company allows for what may be the most environmentally-friendly and scalable battery recycling process in the world. $ABML have a factory 25 miles from Tesla‚Äôs gigafactory and have signed agreements to recycle Ford, Chevrolet and GM‚Äôs battery feedstock. 

The company is currently pre-revenue, however I do believe that will change this year with the opening of their pilot plant. Despite the negative economic outlook we are in at the moment I can really see this stock outperforming the broader market. They‚Äôre flush with cash despite burning through it due to building their new factory. The amount of Lithium within the Tonopah flats alone is worth more than Amazon. 

Who‚Äôs to say Musk doesn‚Äôt buy the company outright? I really don‚Äôt see that as an impossibility given the company‚Äôs purpose, it‚Äôs location and the CEO‚Äôs ties to Tesla. If that happens I‚Äôd probably need to repaint my ceiling cuz my erection would be doing all sorts of damage to it. Anyway thanks for reading, I‚Äôm gonna post a few sources and go play with myself in my mom‚Äôs basement.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%. (Stats as of 2023-02-28)",hardyrekshin,37,1677894077.0

I have had some complaints that people don‚Äôt want me to include supply and demand anymore because its confusing. However, I think its extremely important and I will explain why I cant always interchange supply/ demand with resistance/ support. While at times they are interchangeable these levels hold a different type of weight compared to just my standard price action levels. I am going to include the below excerpt in my TA for a while to hopefully have a reference for people to look back to. If you understand supply/ demand or have read the below then skip to the first chart picture. 

**What is supply and demand?**

The law of supply and demand is a theory that seeks to explain the relationship between the availability and desire for a product, such as a security, and its price. Typically, low availability and high demand boost the price of an item and high availability and low demand reduce its price. The law affects the stock market by determining the prices of the individual stocks that make up the market.

**Demand**

At some point, a stock‚Äôs price will drop enough that buyers will find it attractive. There are many factors that can changes this dynamic. As buyers move into the market for a stock, demand grows faster than supply and so the price will increase. This becomes known as a ‚Äúdemand‚Äù area which one could also call a bigger support area. When price finally reaches that point that buyers say ‚Äúthis is too good to pass up‚Äù then enough buyers come in to establish a new support area or ‚Äúdemand.‚Äù

If demand for a stock exceeds the supply, its price will rise. However, it will only rise to the point where buyers find the price attractive.

**Supply**

As you know, declining demand will cause stock owners to sell. As owners sell (for any reason), the price will fall as there is now more supply than demand. By dropping the price, sellers of the stock hope to encourage someone to buy it. This declining demand causes a new level of selling which is referred to as ‚Äúsupply‚Äù and that would also be known as resistance. 

The dynamic works just the same when demand increases but in reverse. As the price falls, it will reach a level where buyers find the stock attractive, and demand will increase. When investors start buying, the stock‚Äôs price will rise as more and more sellers need to be enticed to sell their shares.

Often supply and demand find equilibrium at a price that buyers accept, and sellers accommodate. When supply and demand balance, so they are roughly equal, prices will gyrate up and down in a narrow price range. We can find many examples of stocks staying in a flat range for days or months before an event disrupts the supply/demand balance.

In short, a supply level IS a resistance level and a demand level IS a support level. However, a resistance level is not always a supply level and a support level is now always a demand level. Why is that? Well because if you take a look at my daily chart we have the black solid horizontal lines (the ones that have always been there‚Ä¶. Plus the color coordinated channels). As you know these support/ resistance lines are established based on daily price action. 

What I do to find my channels is then find an area of price action support/ resistance that time and time again. While one could say these pockets or levels of heavy price action support/ resistance are a supply/ demand zone and sometimes like at 405.8 currently they do match‚Ä¶ they are not always an indicator based supply/ demand zone. 

**How do we trade supply/ demand?**

Now the most important question is this‚Ä¶ how do we trade supply and demand? Well this one is just like how we have always traded our support/ resistance. Lets take the current down trend we are in. In order to bounce what do we need? We need a bounce. We need to reach a support level that is so good that people say fine I will buy back in. Now what is a level that someone finally says lets buy back in? Yes exactly! It‚Äôs a Demand! So we can not establish a ‚Äúbottom‚Äù or ‚Äúbounce‚Äù until a new demand is established. 

So take yesterday we established a new 394.6 demand level and now we are bouncing off that demand level. 

What happens once a new demand (inverse this for support) level is established? The natural flow (assuming we are not in extreme momentum) is that a new demand is established and then price will naturally move up to take out the previous demand. This is moving from support to a previously established support. 

For example. Yesterday we established 394.6 as demand‚Ä¶ assuming we are not in extreme bear momentum‚Ä¶ we would then expect a push back to 400.6 which is the previous demand from 2/23. In general if price action fails to reach that level then we should expect it to come back down to the previous demand of 394.6. However, if price action is able to breach that previous demand level then we ‚Äútake it off the books.‚Äù 

In theory and in general you want to establish higher and higher demands as price is rising. This would be ‚Äúsupporting‚Äù the price action. Same thing in theory when we are coming down. As we drop you want to see the price flow down‚Ä¶ up‚Ä¶ down‚Ä¶ up‚Ä¶ as it is doing this we will establish new supply levels throughout the drop. 

In general supply should always be over demand. IF a supply is established below a demand then that is obviously bearish in nature. IF price action moves up and establishes a new supply without taking out a lower previous supply then one could assume that area will be retested at some point or this would be a ‚Äútarget‚Äù on a bigger sell off. Price action in general does not like to see areas left like that. However, from a demand stand point it is okay to leave previous demands down below. Why? Well because naturally there are more buyers than sellers in the stock market and in general a new demand (support) has to be established in order for price to go up. 

**Summary of supply/ demand**

Supply= resistance. Demand= support. Price moves from Demand (support) to previous supply (resistance). 

Markets flow up and down (support to resistance or demand to supply). In general an area of price action also marked by a supply or demand is a major level to watch. 

Market theory does not want to leave a supply below a demand. However, in order for markets to continue their natural movement up (remember stocks generally speaking go up over time) you need to establish new demands along the way up. 

Let me know if you guys have any questions on this and I will add more details as requested.

Despite correctly calling in pre-market analysis that the ultimate bull target was 400.7 and extreme was 403‚Ä¶ I honestly am shocked we were able to get there today. The bulls 100% impressed me and stumped me a little today. We came within 2 pts of that 4055 target today‚Ä¶. Just an absolutely extreme momentum bear two day bull trend.

So by that nature IF we see that average move we could see SPY settle somewhere around 411.06 to 397.3 on Friday at market close.

Taking a look at the supply and demand chart we are setting up a similar scenario that I was mentioned in the overnight TA‚Ä¶ which was a massive push to 400.7 to take that demand out (which I will remove from the chart after today now) and we will either continue at this point to take out 405.74 demand from 1/30 and continue our push up. Or we are going to potentially establish a new supply (preferably after we take out 405.7 demand). 

IF we establish a supply short of the previous 414-417 supply area then that would be a good short opportunity. However, I would not retake a short on this until we put a new supply in at this point. 

Best bear case for supply/ demand- continue push to take out 405.74 demand -> establish new supply short of previous 414 -> retrace back to previous supply of 396.5 to take that out. 

Best bull case for supply/ demand- continue push to take out 405.74 -> continue push to 414 and reconfirm that as supply. (extreme bull case would be a push straight to 417 (over time) and then turn 414 supply into demand).

Its funny that a lot of people were saying my levels didn‚Äôt make sense and I was saying that showed just how imbalanced this market really was. This move up here finally is giving us an opportunity to balance stuff. 

&#x200B;

Weekly supply/ demand wise not a whole lot going on but it should be note that we do have an area here where we could establish a new demand around this 400 area. 

Weekly supply (upside resistance)- 412.53 -> 427.5 

Weekly demand (downside support)- 382.2 -> 357.3

Now at some point this daily chart HAS to retrace. There is just too many ‚Äúgaps‚Äù in price action down below to now have a meaningful pullback at some point. However, this daily chart looks hella bullish to me and I expect a 405 retest next week. If we can close over that then we could attempt to break back into that 405 to 415 channel leading into CPI on the 14th. 

Bull case- come back down to retest 20ema support -> break through and CLOSE daily candle over 405.3 -> break back into 405 to 415 channel. 

Bear case- hard rejection (no CLOSE) over 405.3 -> come back down and lose daily 20/ 8ema support -> lose key 400 support of the daily 50/200ema.

On a weekly time frame one almost could say this was a MASSIVE bull flag‚Ä¶ not only did we break down and retest weekly 20ema and 8ema support we actually close over those levels and closed over last weeks resistance. This weekly chart looks extremely bullish and is set up for a push back to minimally 407.7 area if this momentum continues. 

From a breakout triangle stand point here we have support at 394.9 and resistance at 409.5 (which is right below previous supply at 410.1). 

Bulls really need to take out 407.7 resistance and have an upside push and close over 412.2. However, bears would really like to see this close minimally back under 396.4 next week. 

Weekly supply (upside resistance)- 412.53 -> 427.5 

Weekly demand (downside support)- 382.2 -> 357.3

Weekly SPY Support- 403.2 -> 396.4 -> 390.1

Weekly SPY Resistance- 407.3 -> 412.4 -> 417.2

Taking a look at the supply/ demand here on futures you can see that beautiful double bottom of 3960 demand (support) which then led to a push back to where we close today. I am actually a little surprised that 4015/4020 supply area didn‚Äôt put up more of a fight than it did. Honestly I am really shocked that futures rallied from 3925 to HOD of 4053 today. That 3.26% from low to high in two trading days (on futures). That‚Äôs one hell of a pump! 

The only upside target here (demand wise) would be 4096. That level correlated with a 1% move up or about 408 on SPY. 

Now of course we have that bigger supply up at 4160 (resistance ) we could target but that‚Äôs a massive move and would be a future target IF momentum continues up. 

Bullish supply/ demand case- establish this 4050-4060 area as supply Monday -> retrace to 3990 and take out both of those supplies -> establish new demand at 3990 (turn previous resistance into support) -> then start a push up again

Bearish supply/ demand case- establish a supply here -> push back to 3990 -> lose 3990 and retrace back below previous 3960 demand (lose previous support).

Now interestingly enough on the weekly supply/ demand chart and this is exactly why I trade spy but watch SPY/ futures‚Ä¶ we just established a new weekly demand at 3970. This means that this sell off here actually put in a higher demand (support) than the previous sell off had. That is VERY bullish and actually signals this as a local bottom. 

Bullish weekly supply/ demand case- use this 3970 demand (support) establishment to push to 4148 supply (resistance) and attempt to turn the 4148 supply (resistance) into demand (support). 

Bearish weekly supply/ demand case- either retest 4148 supply and confirm it as supply (resistance again) and start our descent back to 3970 demand (support) or establish a new supply between 3970 and 4148 and then push back to/ below 3970 demand (support).

From a weekly time frame here on futures we have a very similar pattern. While we did not quite officially touch 3920 pivot point we did touch 3925. This was a really nice weekly double bottom and recovery back over the weekly 8, 20, 50 and 100ema. Only thing that woulda been better is a bullish engulfing weekly candle. 

Weekly breakout/ down triangle here gives us support at 3950 and resistance at 4150.

Weekly supply (resistance)- 4148 -> 4284

Weekly demand (support)- 3970-> 39865 

Future Weekly Support- 4020 -> 3920

Futures weekly Resistance- 4075 ->4095 -> 4150

Honestly with the daily bear channels breaking, retaking of major emas and form a weekly double bottom/ new demand being established as very bullish. My ultimate target is 407.7/ 4075 next week. The only caveat here is that this is pre-CPI week and that can be highly unpredictable. However, most of the data I am seeing is fairly bullish and 2. We have a lot of major data end of next week consumer credit (Tuesday) and JPOW 10am for a report to congress -> ADP employment/ JOLTS (Wednesday) -> jobless (Thursday) -> unemployment rate (Friday). 

We have 4 straight days of huge data/ information from the markets and that is going to make for a volatile week.

This week was good and bad. Lets talk about it in two different areas‚Ä¶ swing trades and level to level (intraday day trading). 

From a swing stand point you can see that did not go very well and is for now the 3rd week in a row (if we include the CPI swing lotto) this is why I have closed a red week. **The biggest lesson is no more swings.** My biggest issue with the swings is there is no set and defined stop loss‚Ä¶ well there is but they usually result in these bigger losses which is harder to recoup. The other issue is talking myself into holding them longer. 

When I look at the **swings** I took I opened last Friday an Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and SPY 30dte put. I also had an AMD and Nvidia put from earlier in the week too.

I honestly expect us to have a more dramatic sell off and while we did EVENTUALLY push lower and come close to that 390/3920 area I was targeting the absolutely brutal rangy chop to get there that we had absolutely wrecked the premiums on the way down. 

I was able to close out on Wednesday and Thursday all my 30dte puts. AMD and Nvidia were very red unfortunately. Looking back I would have just closed those post earnings. The frustrating thing is that AMD especially came within breakeven a few times and seemed like at every potential breakdown would get either a sympathy pump from nvidia, the market or that people taking a stake in it and just take me further and further away. 

Lessons I learned from these 30dte puts‚Ä¶ 1. 60dte puts > 30dte puts. 2. I should have waited for AMD/ nvidia till post earnings. 3. Risk to reward is better with going in on a bigger SPY position instead of numerous tickers. 5. Need a clear cut rule on swings that if > -20% regardless of DTE close position. 

Now from a **DAY TRADING** perspective‚Ä¶ I killed it this week! This was my best week of day trading since the week of January 24th. 

This week I used a few new things that really helped me not only cut positions (losers) faster but gave me the confirmation I need to either get in or not get into a position. Win rate wise I did only see about 71.4% win rate, however, because I only let 3 positions go to stop loss (which I moved to -10% this week) and cut most of my losers around -5 to -6% I was able to turn in a much larger and better profit this week. 

Something I used to do is ‚Äúcommit to a play‚Äù but over commit in reality as I was basically saying I have a stop loss set lets let it run until profit or until we hit stop. However, many times I had ‚Äúsigns‚Äù to exit early. While there are times I will 100% stop myself out early on a rogue bounce 99% of the time cutting these losers early is 100% the play. 

For instance moving my stop loss to -10%, cutting losers early and still keeping the same profits I went from an average of about 0.71% (last week), -0.71% (2/13 week) and 0.38% (week of 2/5) per trade (so this is the average % gain (when factoring all trades +/- % by the total number of trades) to an average of 3.21% this week. 

That‚Äôs nearly a 3x gain of profits % / trade. 

I have always said the biggest lessons for me come from red weeks not green weeks. Despite a red week here I am very happy with the results and I am excited for next week. 

From an overall trading perspective January was a KILLER month for me (had been one of my best months in a long long time) and February was absolutely terrible. It‚Äôs a new month and I couldn‚Äôt be excited going forward. 

I closed all my longs today going to start with a clean slate next week and stick mostly to my intraday trading. Im beyond excited for next week.",DaddyDersch,104,1677882758.0

Billionaire investor Ken Griffin‚Äôs flagship hedge fund matched the broader market‚Äôs performance in the beginning of 2023 following a record year, according to a person familiar with the returns.

Citadel‚Äôs multi-strategy flagship Wellington fund gained 0.7% last month, bringing its 2023 performance to 2.8% through February, the person said. The S&P 500
 lost 2.6% in February, but is still up 3.4% this year through the end of last month.

The stock market staged a rebound in 2023, led by beaten-down tech shares, as investors bet that the worst of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs tightening cycle is over. But some big name investors like Greenlight‚Äôs David Einhorn believe that stocks have more room to fall.

This year‚Äôs gain comes after a stellar year for the hedge fund, which soared 38% in 2022, marking the firm‚Äôs best year ever and outperforming its largest competitor, Millennium, by more than 3 to 1. Citadel has also racked up a nearly 117% return over the three-year period from 2020 to 2022.

Hedge funds aim to offer downside protection during market turmoil, and Citadel managed to shine during the worst chaos in the market in years. The S&P 500 tumbled into a bear market in 2022 as recession fears intensified on the back of the Fed‚Äôs aggressive rate hikes to tame the highest inflation in 40 years.

Macro hedge funds, those making bets around political or economic events, have fared particularly well as tighter monetary policy from global central banks stoked wild moves in different asset classes, from bonds to stocks, and commodities to currencies.

Citadel‚Äôs equities fund, which uses a long/short strategy, is up 2.4% this year, while its global fixed income fund is higher by 1.6% so far in 2023, the person said.

Citadel‚Äôs assets under management exceeded $54 billion as of the start of 2023.

>TLDR, Kenny Boy is making returns that his competitors don't even come close to without explanation. There is no way this is possible without acquiring information not publicly available to his competitors OR (more likely) Citadel must be taking a lot of risks to make these returns for a hedge fund.

11h2ee7,Morning Briefing - Mar 3rd 2023,"This morning, U.S. stock futures increased as investors considered the Federal Reserve's interest rate strategy following remarks from central bank officials. The Nasdaq-100 futures went up by 0.3%, and the S&P 500 futures gained 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures increased by 33 points. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury yields decreased, with the benchmark 10-year yield dropping over 6 basis points to 4%, and the 2-year rate falling to 4.855%. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow are all expected to have a positive week. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic believes that the central bank can limit interest rate hikes to 25 basis points, while Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller warns of a higher terminal rate if inflation continues to rise. The Institute of Supply Management will release its Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers‚Äô Index report on Friday, and investors will also be listening to comments from other central bank officials. According to Morgan Stanley, Apple's shares could rise by 20% due to multiple upcoming catalysts, including new product launches and an iPhone subscription program. Chief economist and strategist of Rosenberg Research, David Rosenberg, believes that the stock market will have a sustained rally once the labor market starts to contract in three to four months, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to reverse its tightening policy.

11gr23b,"Think loan forgiveness will cost taxpayers a lot? The Fed: ""Hold my beer."" ---> $1T","**According to a policy brief by Andrew Levin and Bill Nelson, QE4 will cost taxpayers nearly a $1T over the next decade.**

Andrew Levin is a professor of monetary economics at Dartmouth with numerous prior roles at the Fed board.  Bill Nelson is a professor at Georgetown and chief economist of the Bank Policy Institute, with an expertise in bank liquidity.

The ample-reserves regime (floor system of managing interbank lending) of blasting banks with excess reserves seemingly worked fine during ZIRP.  However, the expense to service all this excess liquidity is *turning out to be incredibly costly*.

Where does the cost come from?  In order to service the massive liquidity created by QE4, the Fed can only control interest rates with a ""floor system"" of providing extremely generous payments to banks via reserves (IORB = interest on reserve balances) and the RRP facility aka reverse repos.  It is essentially a *bribe* to keep the federal funds rate from free-falling back to 0 or potentially even negative.

The result?  Fed will operate at a loss for the first time in history and by suspending payments to the treasury, it will cost taxpayers nearly $1T over the next decade.  ""Money printing"" with QE involves buying bonds that *eventually* mature and sucks money back from circulation.  In some sense it is a loose metaphor.  Currently, the Fed is actually printing dollars out of thin air with no oversight.

**All of this done with zero warning of the magnitude of risks and zero approval by Congress.**  The beautiful part?  This doesn't even include the extra cost to taxpayers of higher rates being required to tame inflation and thereby increasing borrowing costs that are being artificially propped up.  The Fed is not alone in this reckless irresponsibility.  This is happening to every major CB across the world.

**TL;DR In 2023, the Fed is creating a precedent that it can borrow unlimited funds from the American taxpayer, with no set maturity or repayment date, with zero warning to the public, discussion of benefits vs. costs, or approval from Congress.**

Edit: what is the floor system?  It is a new way that the Fed, along with CB's around the world began managing interest rates during the GFC.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%. (Stats as of 2023-02-28)",hardyrekshin,40,1677809037.0

The large asset management company and real estate investor attempted to request an extension from the bondholders for the repayment of the debt. However, the bondholders turned down the request, as per the sources cited in the report on Thursday.

In addition to this, Blackstone's $71 billion unlisted real estate income trust (BREIT) has been struggling as well. On Wednesday, BREIT stated that it had to restrict withdrawals for the fourth month in a row.

[Property values are dropping](https://aliffcapital.com/real-estate-investment-opportunities-and-risks/) in Europe as rising interest rates put off buyers until a clearer picture about how far rates will rise emerges.

About a third of all loans in commercial-mortgage backed securities maturing in 2023 and 2024 face high refinancing risks, according to a study published by Scope Ratings in January. 

Concerns about how far values could fall are encouraging lenders to push for sales more quickly, while borrowers would prefer more time to seek higher offers for their properties.

In February, Christopher J Waller received data that challenged his previous view that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was making significant progress in moderating economic activity and reducing inflation. 

The data included a significant increase in job openings in December, which reversed several months of gradual easing and indicated tightness in the labor market. 

Retail sales for January also came in stronger than expected, suggesting the economy was slowing less than previously thought. 

Waller believes that continuing progress on inflation depends on lowering demand and moderating economic activity, and that the fight to bring inflation down to the 2% target will be slower and longer than expected. 

The next employment report and CPI release, ahead of the March 21-22 FOMC meeting, will provide information that will affect Waller's assessment of the appropriate next step for monetary policy.

11gjrzn,Taking Seth Klarman's Approach to Assessing SNDL,"***Disclaimer: (The material listed in this article is current as of the date noted, and is for informational purposes only, and does not contend to address the financial objectives, situation, or specific needs of any individual investor. Any information is for illustrative purposes only, and is not intended to serve as investment advice.)***

In this analysis I won't provide a particular recommendation or conclusion, rather, I will only walk through the thought process.

====

Seth Klarman is a successful value investor and the founder of Baupost Group. His investment philosophy is centered around the concept of the **margin of safety**, which is the idea of investing in securities that are trading below their intrinsic value.

In general, a good margin of safety is one that provides a cushion against potential losses due to unforeseen events or market downturns. This means buying an asset at a significant discount to its intrinsic value. As a rule of thumb, a margin of safety of **30% or more** is often considered a good starting point for value investors. However, the appropriate margin of safety will depend on various factors.

He emphasizes patience and discipline when making investment decisions, where one should maintain a long-term investment horizon and avoiding the temptation to chase short-term gains.

Some high level things to look for when trying to pick a company:

1. Strong financials: Companies that have a history of generating consistent cash flows and profits, and that have a solid balance sheet with manageable levels of debt.
2. Competitive advantage: Companies that have a sustainable competitive advantage, whether it be through a strong brand, a unique product or service offering, or a dominant market position.
3. Good management: The quality of a company's management team is critical to its success, so companies should have experienced and competent leaders who are aligned with shareholders.
4. Valuation: Buy stocks at a discount to their intrinsic value, so companies that are trading at a price that is lower than we believe the company is truly worth.
5. Growth potential: Finally, companies that have strong growth potential, whether it be through expanding into new markets, launching new products or services, or through organic growth.

Let's explore each item from someone who's looking at SNDL as a potential addition to their portfolio:

\- Strong financials (Weak):

* SNDL doesn't have a consistent cash flow and profit history, where it is only recently that the company had achieved a positive Adjusted EBITDA (mainly due to it's newly acquired liquor business).
* It's preferable to pick companies with a net profit margin of at least 10%. SNDL's net profit margin is currently **-54.54%**.
* It is preferable to pick companies with manageable levels of debt and that its debt-to-equity ratio is below 1. SNDL's debt-to-equity ratio is **0.18**.
* A current ratio of at least 1.5 indicates that the company has sufficient liquidity to meet its short-term obligations. SNDL's current ratio is **6.60**.
* It is preferable to pick companies with a strong return on equity (ROE) of at least 15%. SNDL's ROE is **-18.89%.**

\- Competitive advantage (Medium): It comes from a highly competitive Canadian cannabis market, where its collection of different brands and incorporation of the liquor business provide it with a decent product mix. Also a strong balance sheet makes it easier for the company to do quick moves when the time is right. That being said, would this be considered sustainable? How long till that money turns into a bad investment decision? Compared to its competitors it has a very unique mix of assets.

\- Good management (Medium): Zachary George has done a good job at consolidating and concentrating company efforts. He has a good understanding of the company's challenges and has a very good wholistic understanding of the cannabis ecosystem, it's safe to say that he doesn't have tunnel vision when it comes to his planning of the operations. That being said, positive financial operational performance has been mainly driven from non-cannabis related operations.

\- Valuation (Strong): You can preform your own valuation when it comes to SNDL, but for the purposes of this demonstrational analysis, I'm going to be looking at the Analyst Price Targets posted on Yahoo finance.

The range of values is from a $2.98 low to a $5.96 high and an average of $4.12, for a conservative margin of safety approach we would want to look at the lower end estimate as our starting point. We would then apply the 30% margin of safety which would result in a $2.086 price point. Currently SNDL is trading at around $1.8 which means that it is around the purchasing range which would incorporate the margin of safety.

\- Growth potential (Strong): We all understand that the company's cash position is good. Sitting at around CAD$649,031,000 there is no idea what the management team will do with it. But from the looks of things, it seems that they are maybe simply looking to dominate the Canadian market.

Overall, while each of the factors I mentioned is important, strong financials are a critical component of any good investment opportunity, and should not be overlooked. Companies with sustainable business models, strong balance sheets, and consistent profitability are the ones that tend to create long-term value for shareholders.

11gj983,Temporary bottom or dead cat bounce?... 3-2-23 SPY/ ES Futures Daily Market Analysis,"I had some questions yesterday about my supply/ demand levels on SPY and why they may have seemed ‚Äúoff.‚Äù So let me explain a little. 

The gauge/ indicator identifies new levels either supply or demand. and unless it ""takes it out"" then its still there. Thats where this price action on SPY is VERY weird because like you said we should NOT establish a supply and then be over it and be under a demand like that either. however, with the current price action and these wild 1% +/- gap ups/ downs thats where the technicals are showing something that just isn‚Äôt quite playing out yet‚Ä¶ it just is an testament to how odd this price action has been and how irrational it truly has been. (below information is from last night not todays charts/ price action). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uq0mqvvcqela1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dce14a8e43717623fd24278596669c5fbf001cfe

The issue is that its not flipping the name of supply/ demand but the issue is because SPY is only intraday trading but really its tracking with ES we are getting these massive gap ups that is messing price action up... look at futures and you can see its not like that at all... we ARE breaking through previous 3975 demand but just established a new one at 3960 which makes sense. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lxsr3cedqela1.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=09c69e16d3b302d796351150fcf416db30674766

However, looking at SPY here this is the issue... so we formed super nice resistance at that 414+ area and then we started our descent and the way the price action has happened we put in demand at 405.74. From there we had a really nice bounce which took out a demand at 409.6... this opens downside back to the demand. So the issue comes in that we had that huge 2% drop last Tuesday which then resulted in a goofy massive wick day on Thursday that established a demand.

The next issue is that we did not push up to take out the 405.7 demand we just continued to dump.

Same thing this week we had a huge absolutely weird movement on Friday cause of data which put in oddly a supply (granted not a strong one but its there and enough to note)... and now we are pushing back down...

So what REALLY needs to happen to ""balance"" this out is for SPY to establish demand down here somewhere form 388 to 396. push all the way back to 405.74 demand. and then either retrace to confirm a new demand. or establish that as a new supply and then we can start our fall back down.

So what im saying and honestly its funny (I posted all this last night in the TA comments but just recapping it) is that we are seeing this play out now‚Ä¶ in this scenario we will push back to 400.7/ 3990 area and then we will be more balanced and looking better technical wise. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yz7cyfwdqela1.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=791aff7701ae8577afb074663e153f3770c57056

If you were wondering what the change today and the massive pump came from was Bostic‚Ä¶ So just like that a 50bps scare flash crashes the market and then a 25bps discussion spikes the market‚Ä¶ 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cnbypvbeqela1.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=09132536b4850e1401bd19d41e3f828af676cfe1

Oddly enough the current estimate is still at 30% for a 50bps and has not come down. Im not sure if this CME is live or not so this probably overnight will see an adjustment. 

Where does that leave us then? Are we bullish? Bearish? Or is this a temporary bottom? Relief bounce? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hlwlqdqeqela1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a0a052258e8cdc06497437b528a2152cbd5e7a2f

Lets take a look at our current supply and demand daily levels. Today was a big day for sure. 

On SPY we have established with this push up today 394.7 as a new demand level. With that demand on SPY itself we have an upside demand of 400.7 and 405.7. Now SPY is as I mentioned yesterday in extreme bear momentum so most bounces should reject off the daily 8ema. However, if we can close a green day tomorrow we very well could break that extreme bear momentum as we had just entered it on the 27th and are not very deep into it yet. 

If we can continue momentum tomorrow my target would be 400.7 demand level which is going to corelate perfectly with a daily 20ema resistance test. 

On SPY supply wise we have that 396.5 area and besides that the next major supply level is up near 414-417. 

Supply and demand for SPY wise the most bullish case here which is support by indicator is that we will go up tomorrow potentially as high as 400.7 (but honestly we don‚Äôt need to go that high), establish a NEW supply somewhere over 396.5. Then early next week a healthy retrace to take out that 396.5 supply and potentially confirm demand at 394.6 would absolutely open upside to 405 area. This is the scenario I most closely am watching for. 

On a bearish supply and demand case for SPY If we were to fail to breakout to 400.7 which is probable since we did not have any meaningful pullback today and we establish a new supply up here this could have been a dead cat bounce. IF that happens and we reject this daily 8ema retest here especially if we double top then I would be eyeing us to come down and retest previous demand at 388.5 early next week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/39df6aafqela1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4cbf0631618efd9816c6de81fb88c60926d3b3b8

Taking a look at the daily chart here you can see we broke through that red falling wedge/ bear channel which does give us upside to the black resistance which will be around 401.9 tomorrow and also coordinates with a daily 20ema resistance retest. 

Bulls were able to retake the daily 100ema today however, they are going to face heavy resistance as we come into that 400 to 400.6 level as that is the daily 50/200ema and that is previous demand and we should have the daily 20ema lingering right above there. 

With this daily bullish engulfing candle here I remain short term bullish. I really was hoping for this to hold closing to 397 and see a bigger pullback to take out some 15 minute chart supplies down at 396 first. With the daily 8ema being here and extreme momentum we are likely to see a rejection here or at least minimally retest support down below. I was planning to long here with a 30dte call however we did not pullback and I do believe that will come tomorrow. 

There is potential if bulls can close on a bullish note tomorrow‚Ä¶ which would be a close over 396.4 that this is a bullish and I would suspect a run up next week into CPI. 

Supply- 396.5 -> 414.13 

Demand- 394.64 -> 400.7 -> 405.7

Key SPY Support- 394.6 -> 392.7 -> 391.5

Key SPY Resistance- 397.9 -> 400 -> 400.7 -> 401.6

Taking a look here at the futures daily supply/ demand chart you can see that we nearly last night came down within 5 pts of the 3920 demand from 1/19. While we did not touch it that is still very bullish in nature to have that long of a wick. Now this is where TOS and TV differ but on TOS this is a double bottom/ bullish engulfing candle with is bullish. 

With a new demand now established at 3960 we have officially taken out previous 3975 demand. You can see though as I mentioned on Spy with us being in extreme bear momentum that the most probable place for a rejection is the daily 8ema which is where we rejected and not only that but we rejected off that 3990 supply. 

If bulls can continue momentum there is a case to be made where we could close over 4020 tomorrow, establish a new supply and then end up coming back down next week to take out 4015 and 3990 supply. This would be very bullish. If bulls lose 3960 on a retest though that would signify that we are gong to come back down to that 3920 demand eventually. 

On the daily I do see on both SPY and futures a IV drop (bullish) and I do see reversal conditions set up volatility wise. This could all set us up for this to actually be the temporary bottom. 

My thoughts are with the fed members talking about 25bps now and talking about how CPI was a fake rebound (or temporary) that this actually is setting us up for a rally back to 405 next week prior to CPI.

Taking a look here at futures you can see the same thing that we are coming in closely here on the daily 100ema and 8ema. Both of which did hold as resistance today. IF this continues tomorrow upward the 4020 level is going to be a major resistance level as that is going to be the daily 20, 50 and 200 ema along with being a previous supply level. 

From a bullish standpoint a closure over 3975 tomorrow would be extremely bullish for the weekly timeframe. 

Supply- 3990 -> 4015

Demand- 3920 -> 3960 -> 4096

Key Futures Support- 3975 -> 3960 -> 3945 -> 3920

Key Futures Resistance- 3985 -> 3990 -> 4016 -> 4020

**TESLA TA will no longer be included.** I have found I am being pulled in too many places.. my own fault‚Ä¶ I will no longer be focusing on Tesla in my daily TA. It is something I will chat about occasionally but it just isn‚Äôt something I plan to trade anymore.

Taking a look at the VIX here this was a pretty impressive drop on the VIX. We actually have broken back under 19.6 for the first time since February 16th. Which was the first day of the current down trend that we are in. This 19.6 is a pretty major pivot level here and this could also with this massively bearish engulfing candle signify a local bottom. 

I do think the evidence of a bottom is there and I do think that if we close over 3975 tomorrow that there is a high probability that we see a push to the upside next week. 

Next week is pre-CPI week which historically does move a good amount. The case of a rally into CPI now instead of a dump into CPI is growing here. We have two more fed speakers tomorrow and we will have to see what they have to say compared to what the fed speakers said today.

Overall day trading today and really this week has been pretty excellent. I am very satisfied with my trading and how the week has gone. Strictly from a day trading perspective one of my better weeks in a while. 

Today I finally cut my AMD and Nvidia swings for a loss from last week. I really should have waited on Nvidia earnings before I opened AMD/ nvidia last week but honestly based off other tech I had very little to suggest they would beat let alone rally 12% like they did. I also though that would be a blow off top and would drop us even lower after. 

Unfortunately I considered pretty much all day cutting AMD which was around -25 to -28% all day and Nvidia around -60 to -65% all day. I finally decided by EOD I would cut them and then that investor decided to announce a huge stake in AMD and I watched the price pump $1.2 before my eyes and premiums drop a top. I bailed then and im glad I did as that took a huge pump right after. 

Looking at my long puts I was able to close them all besides AMD and Nvidia for profits. I had plenty of opportunities (especially on AMD‚Ä¶) to close them for much less but I kept holding thinking it would finally retrace. 

Would I take the play again? Yes but I would have waited till after earnings this time. Not a big deal gonna close my week red but that‚Äôs alright. I still like the trade in the end of the day.",DaddyDersch,80,1677798393.0

11ge76y,THE CASE FOR GOING LONG CRUDE OIL (UNITED STATE OIL FUND),"&#x200B;

[Current Position: I'll roll this 2 times per week and shoot to make an extra $800 per month with $27,000 and once on Fridays I'll roll it to the next weeks expire same strike or less.](https://preview.redd.it/fbssna1j5ela1.jpg?width=920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0d3dca4065703363f69eacad043ae704e6fb7c28)

I started selling cash covered puts on USO today. I have been a huge fan of doing so on QQQJ for years but it is time for some oil. Below is my DD. I did my best to clean it up, I hope it's valuable.

June 1, 2008 the United States Oil Fund was at $909.28 per share. On April 27, 2020 the United States Oil Fund was at its lowest ever price of $18.86. In todays case study we explore the Federal Reserve and price action from 2006 until March 2023, present.

## When to Trade Oil Successfully, Three Patterns

* One pattern that is evident is that the price of WTI **Crude oil** & USO tends to be **higher** towards the **end of the year** and **lower** towards the **beginning of the year**.   
*\*\*The price of crude oil is consistently lower in January and February, and higher in October, November, and December.* 
* Another pattern is that the **price** of WTI **Crude oil** & USO tends to be **more volatile during the first quarter of the year**.   
*\*\*For example, NYSEArca: USO, the range between the high and low prices is much larger for the months of January, February, and March compared to the other months.*
* Average percentage change is 5.34% to 5.91% between monthly time periods based on USO open and close data from 2020 to 2023  
*\*\*For example you know prices will swing month to month about these % changes.*  


## The Current State of Crude Oil & It‚Äôs Effectors

* The state of the global economy can drive up or down demand for oil, as can geopolitical events such as conflicts in major oil-producing regions. 
* Changes in technology and energy policy, such as the rise of renewable energy sources, can also affect demand for oil. 
* The effects of US macro news on commodity prices, including oil, are stronger during periods of high market volatility, and the effects of monetary policy are more pronounced for energy commodities. 
* The price of oil tends to be more volatile during the first quarter of the year, higher towards the end of the year, and is generally increasing over time, with some fluctuations. 

### More Patterns Based on USO Stock Price Data Since 2016

There has been a recent decline in energy prices, which is expected to continue throughout the year, potentially providing some relief for households.

1. The overall trend of the USO stock price seems to be increasing over time, with some fluctuations along the way. This suggests that the company has been performing well and growing in value I‚Äôd say and shows demand growing.
2. The trading volume tends to be higher in months where there is a significant change in the USO stock price. For example, the highest trading volume in the dataset occurred in March 2022 when the stock price had a large increase.
3. There are some months where the opening and closing prices are very similar, indicating that there wasn't much volatility during that period. For example, in January 2022, the opening and closing prices were within a few cents of each other.
4. There are also some months where the range between the high and low prices is quite large, indicating that there was significant volatility during that period. For example, in October 2022, the high price was almost $14 higher than the low price.

### The Summarized Case for Global Growth, War, 10-Year & Historically Low Oil Prices

As of March 2, 2023, the current state of the global economy is having a significant impact on the relationship between oil and other economic indicators, particularly the 10-year period. Historically, in periods of economic growth, there is an increase in demand for oil and oil prices, while a downturn in the economy results in a decrease in both demand and prices. Presently, the 10-year period is at an all-time high, indicating a positive outlook for the global economy. This is attributed to the world's successful comeback from the COVID-19 pandemic that brought many economies to a standstill.

The price of WTI Crude oil and USO tends to be more volatile during the first quarter of the year, higher towards the end of the year, and is generally increasing over time, with some fluctuations. Recent data shows that there has been a decline in energy prices, which is expected to continue throughout the year, potentially providing some relief for households.

Macroeconomic news releases and monetary policies, particularly those from the United States, have a significant impact on commodity prices. Positive news typically results in an increase in prices, while negative news leads to a decrease. Currently, the news has been neutral, and no significant changes in commodity prices have been observed.

Geopolitical events such as conflicts in oil-producing regions can have a significant impact on oil supply and cause prices to spike. The ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, coupled with a high demand for oil in China and India, has the potential to drive oil prices up. Therefore, it is essential to keep an eye on geopolitical events as they remain a key factor that could disrupt oil supply and drive prices up in the future.

Based on the patterns observed, the price of crude oil is consistently lower in January and February and higher in October, November, and December. In addition, the price tends to be more volatile during the first quarter of the year, with a higher trading volume in months where there is a significant change in the USO stock price.

Overall, while the global economy's positive outlook and neutral news have had a stabilizing effect on commodity prices, geopolitical events remain a key factor that could disrupt oil supply and drive prices up in the future. Therefore, it is crucial to weigh the potential risks and rewards before making any investment decisions in oil stocks.

## A Trading Strategy Tweetsift Follows

We will focus on selling bi-weekly cash covered puts on USO for an extra $200 per week in income with $28,000 in our account. If assigned we will actively sell cash covered calls. According to the research starting in October we will see the price of oil go higher like it does every year. 

With the volatility of the beginning of the year is over with and the middle of the year here, demand coming back. job growth doing well, housing market still doing OK and a new global increase in manufacturing demand, we here at Tweetsift think this is a great time to enter into WTI Brent Crude futures and USO.",the-tweetsift-report,24,1677791557.0

11gdpdq,Desktop Metal: A Ten-Bagger Tesla Story,"**Introduction**

Hey guys, I'm a long time member occasional contributor. Three years ago I [posted](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cpeu8i/petition_to_give_ubetterthanmadoff_a_very_special/) after a special autist posted some incredible DD after the market closed on a Friday about an impending market crash in Argentina. Last August, I [posted](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wlqb4q/desktop_metal_dd_long_term_tenbagger_and/) my first Desktop Metal DD thread on r/wallstreetbets. It's been a pretty tough year for the stock market and unprofitable tech companies like DM have been hammered hard. However, things are beginning to look much better for DM. Before I get into my DD, here's some background on the company:

**Background**

Desktop Metal went public via SPAC in 2021. They produce a revolutionary line of incredibly fast 3D printers that can compete with traditional casting on a price per part basis. They hold over 650 patents and can print in over 250 different materials. Their flagship product is the [Production System](https://www.desktopmetal.com/products/production) which began to ship. Designed for mass production of end use metal parts, it is over 100x faster than traditional 3D printing technologies putting it leaps ahead of its competition. Their product offering also includes the [Shop System](https://www.desktopmetal.com/products/shop) for mid-volume production, the [Studio System](https://www.desktopmetal.com/products/studio) for prototyping, Fiber for the 3D printing of a variety of carbon fibers, their new unit [Desktop Health](https://www.desktophealth.com/) for a variety of uses including dental, bone regeneration, soft tissue fabrication, and organ 3D printing. Recently, Desktop Metal released the Einstein Pro XL, an affordable production-grade 3D printer for dental labs and other medical professionals. You can read the press release [here](https://ir.desktopmetal.com/news/press-releases/detail/139/desktop-health-announces-global-availability-of-einstein). Recently revenue growth has been largely driven by the expansion of their healthcare unit. Photopolymers are a great addition to DM's portfolio and represent a $200B market opportunity. 

In the last two years, they've made several important acquisitions with the $500mm they recieved as a result of going public via SPAC. In August 2021, they acquired their largest competitor, ExOne for $561mm in a mixed stock/cash deal. Desktop Metal has been incredible aggressive, spending over $800mm to buy out their competitors and adding new materials to their portfolio. They have 950+ issued patents and pending applications for their machines and materials. Their Studio System sells for roughly $300k and generates $1.1mm in lifetime revenue with 600k being profit. This is driven by the high profit margins on their materials. I believe that their materials portfolio represents the key to Desktop Metals long term growth and profitability.

As a result of these acquisitions, Desktop Metal grew rapidly. There were many redundancies that were eating into EBITDA and driving continued losses. Last year, Desktop Metal announced a $50mm cost cutting initiative as well as the hiring of a new CFO, Jason Cole, formerly of Analog Devices. On February 6th, [Desktop Metal announced another $50mm in cost cutting measures](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/desktop-metal-boosts-productivity-by-updating-cost-cutting-plans-for-2023-220642/#:~:text=Industrial%203D%20printer%20manufacturer%20Desktop,its%20long%2Dterm%20financial%20objectives.) for a total of $100mm in annual cost reductions. Jason has demonstrated a strong desire to achieve profitability as soon as possible over growth at all costs.

As companies look to shorten and de-risk their supply chains, Desktop Metal provides a compelling product to reduce material waste and cut costs. Their printers are already used by companies like BMW, Lockheed Martin, Stanley Black and Decker, and many more. Their products have additional aerospace, automotive, consumer goods, medical, and military applications. Revenue has grown significantly from $26mm in FY 2019 to $206mm in FY 2022. FY 2023 revenue is projected between $210-260mm due to macro headwinds with breakeven EBITDA being achieved in Q3 or Q4.

**Why DM is Attractive**

Desktop Metals Q4 earnings were fantastic and exactly what investors needed to see. The result of their $100mm cost cutting initiatives are beginning to show through on their income statement. Operating expenses [fell to $37.9mm in Q4 2022, down $3.6mm from Q3](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_78b61139c42c8f258a21fe79e9c13a8a/desktopmetal/db/884/7565/earnings_presentation/DM+4Q-22+Earnings+Presentation+vF.pdf). During the Q&A portion of the call, an analyst asked about what revenue would be required for DM to breakeven next year. The CFO, Jason Cole, stated that DM would breakeven across the whole forcasted revenue range of $210-260mm. This is **huge**. Desktop Metal has been priced for the last year as if it was on the verge of bankrupcy. Until today's 30%+ surge, Desktop Metal was valued less than the market value of their competitor ExOne which they acquired last year for $560mm. The market has been confused with how to value Desktop Metal and this is why I think we have such an incredible opportunity in front of us today. Craig-Hallum analyst Greg Palm [released in a note](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3673587&headline=dm-craighallum-warming-to-desktop-metal-after-new-supply-agreement-1677774515&test2&ref=tipranks) said that he is ""warming up to Desktop Metal"" following ""solid Q4 results"" and that ""momentum seems to be building in several areas of the business."" While he kept his $2 price target and a hold rating, he said this was ""to wait for additional evidence of business trends improvement"" but that ""he believe the stock can work higher from current levels.""

While I was also bullish six months ago in August, my thesis was that the risk/reward profile of bankrupcy to non-bankrupcy was favorable. Yesterday, we got confirmation that Desktop Metal would **NOT** go bankrupt and achieve profitability in FY 2024 -- a full year ahead of schedule. They have $750mm in assets ($360mm in current assets) and $260mm in liabilities per their 10-K released yesterday. This guarantees that they have enough of a runway to reach 2024 where they will achieve full year profitability. Desktop Metal also teased on the earnings call that they will soon be announcing a Master Supply Agreement signed with a major consumer electronics company that per Twitter, is rumored to be Apple. If true, it would mark a major milestone for DM. Despite this, short interest was 21% before yesterdays earnings per [Koyfin](https://app.koyfin.com/snapshot/s/eq-0digtg) -- even higher than it was when I posted in August. You can read their full Q4 2022 earnings report [here](https://ir.desktopmetal.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001558370-23-002567/0001558370-23-002567.pdf) and their press release [here](https://ir.desktopmetal.com/news/press-releases/detail/141/desktop-metal-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022). 


**This Is A Tesla Story**

In late 2019 and early 2020, Tesla demonstrated something very similar to what DM showed in their earnings yesterday -- that they would not be going bankrupt and that they had a viable road to profitability. Just like with DM, people knew that the technology was going to change entire industries and investors didn't want to get left behind even if they had to pay a premium for a piece of the pie. Tesla shares exploded, rising from around $20 per share to a peak of $400 per share last year. I believe that yesterday was a monumental moment for Desktop Metal, and the market seems to agree. As of 3:30PM, shares are up 38% trading around $2.08.


If DM were to generate $0.50 in EPS and trade at **moderate** 20x current P/E, shares would trade at $10 per share for a 400% return from current levels. With >20% EPS growth, DM could achieve EPS of >$1.00 per share by 2030 for a **conservative** share price of $20 for a 900% return. EPS growth of >40% is possible for DM even in challenging macro headwinds. Considering that DM's profit largely comes from their consumables, they will become increasingly profitable with time as their machines sell and customers continue buying DM's expansive material inventory. Other fast growth tech companies like Cloudflare trade at P/E's in the **hundreds** due to their high projected revenue and EPS growth. At it's peak, TSLA traded at 500x forward EPS! If DM traded at even half of Tesla's old forward EPS in 2025, we could see a share price in the hundreds. 


**My Positions**

2000 shares at $2.40

2 $2.50 Jan 2025 call

3 $3.00 Jan 2025 calls

4 $4.00 Jan 2025 calls 

6 $5.00 Jan 2025 calls


**Conclusion**

When Desktop Metal begins to get more press, people are going to pile into the company. It has all the ingredients for a meteoric rise. Transformative new technology, some media hype, and **did I mention that 28% of all shares are short?** There's a potential short squeeze in the cards. Desktop Metal is a no-brainer for ~$2.00 in 2023. While I'm not going to give a price target, I think that Desktop Metal has an insane amount of room to run. Let me know your thoughts!

11gci6s,Dear Bulls....,"After getting slapped around for what seems like 50 sessions, the Bulls are celebrating because Fed Bostic said he was firmly in the 25 bps camp.  Ok, let's disregard the fact that the trend on daily and weekly is down.  Also, their is a HUUGE resistance level at 4000, 400 - 50dmova, 200dmova.  Also, since the Fed's notes, my back of the napkin score of economic releases is Bears-5 and Bulls-1; more news was bearish.

Point is, there's still not much to celebrate out of this move intraday if it doesn't stick and if there is no follow through tomorrow.  As I said over a week ago, the market might just pin itself to this 4000 level as it would frustrate bulls and bears.

I have no idea if those huge ODTE trades these past few weeks that have been moving the market will occur today but until it stops, I would be concerned the ""odie"" traders will flip the market again, like they have been doing.

As for Bostic, he appears to be a good guy:  [Fed's Bostic acknowledges trades broke rules, fixes records - ABC News (go.com)](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/feds-bostic-acknowledges-trades-broke-rules-fixes-records-91523347)",mrnotadvice,29,1677787661.0
11gc3k8,What happens when a bank goes under for all the institutions with loans from that bank?,"I stopped watching silvergate after the 46% drop earlier this year [article explaining the withdrawals that led to it ](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/01/05/silvergate-cuts-40-jobs-writes-off-diem-asset-acquisition/). I saw it rallied back to 22 and is in the process of imploding now. 

SI claimed it benefitted from rising rates as it theoretically held non-yielding assets (for example from MSTR) and garnered yield on its loaned dollars.

Obviously, that narrative has fallen apart. I‚Äôm not degenerate enough to short from here and my initial bear thesis was counterparty risk. It looks like SI is the risky counterparty though.

What happens to institutions with loans from SI? MSTR famously took a 205mm collateralized loan to purchase more of the devil‚Äôs corn. Without the loan docs, it‚Äôs not evident to me if whoever purchases SIs assets (namely those counterparties‚Äô liabilities), will renegotiate terms or if there‚Äôs some accelerated payback clause.

Without further DD, I think COIN probably bounces back because the exposure seems overstated. I think MSTR still ultimately fails to cover their 2.4B total loans, but this seems short term bullish if they can repay at a discount (even though the assets they purchased with said loan are about 50% down from when the loan was originated [price was over 46k on March 29 2022](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/03/29/microstrategys-unit-gets-205m-collateral-loan-from-silvergate-to-buy-bitcoin/)).

Anyway, positions are neutral COIN (bull from this doesn‚Äôt overcome other headwinds), Short SI (not puts though as there can be snap backs ), Short MSTR although I might close shorter dated puts)",wincrypton,15,1677786710.0

Whether you love or hate Jim Cramer, you‚Äôre now able to express that view via the magic of ETFs.

A pair of new products launched Thursday that will help investors bet either on or against the stock picks of the host of CNBC‚Äôs *Mad Money* show.

The Inverse Cramer Tracker ETF (ticker [SJIM](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SJIM:US)) seeks to deliver returns that correspond to ‚Äúthe inverse of securities mentioned by Cramer‚Äù by either short-selling his equity picks or buying companies he recommends against, according to its prospectus.¬†

Meanwhile, the Long Cramer Tracker ETF ([LJIM](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/LJIM:US)) will back shares the CNBC anchor likes and ditch the ones he doesn‚Äôt.

The funds are the latest brainchild of the manager behind the anti-ARK product, the $551 million AXS Short Innovation Daily ETF ([SARK](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SARK:US)), which achieved rapid notoriety by creating an easy way to wager against Cathie Wood‚Äôs flagship strategy. 

Now Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, has turned his attention to Cramer, fulfilling a long-running finance joke that the CNBC anchor should get his own inverse fund.",bloomberg,82,1677770742.0

We killed it with the CRM 3/3 175c calls, the stock is up 16% touching 195. Congrats guys on those who bought. 

This morning, the S&P 500 futures experienced a decline due to concerns over rising interest rates, which led to a sell-off in the market. According to a note from JPMorgan's trading desk, this puts the S&P 500 at risk of breaking below a crucial chart level, potentially accelerating bearish price pressures. Nasdaq-100 futures also dropped 0.8%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures saw a small gain, driven by strong performance from Salesforce shares. Other notable movements included Okta shares jumping on solid earnings and guidance, and Tesla shares losing 5% after the company failed to provide details on its next-generation vehicles during its much-anticipated investor day on Wednesday. Additionally, the rise in bond yields and concerns of a potentially larger-than-expected hike from the Federal Reserve have fueled investor concern, putting a dent in the early 2023 rally. Investors are awaiting jobless claims and other economic data, while a speech from Fed Governor Christopher Waller is scheduled for Thursday afternoon. A disappointing investor day for Tesla could also have broader market implications.

**Overall Market Outlook**

SPY - Bearish indecisive spinning top candle close on the daily TF. We bounced from the daily 200WMA and currently sitting above the 200MA and 200WMA on the daily. We also have a possible double bottom on the daily. And we are still squeezing on the 4Hr TF. Expected Move +/- $3.34

QQQ - Bearish candle close on the daily TF. We bounced from the daily 200MA and currently sitting above it. And we have a possible double bottom on the daily. And we are still in a squeeze on the 4Hr TF. Expected Move +/- $3.24

**Watchlist**

TSLA- Bearish candle close on the daily TF. We sold off and closed below the 8Ema on the daily. We also started to squeeze on the daily. And we filled some of the gap below but still have more to fill below 198.52 down to 197.67 area. That head&shoulders worked out in are favor! Take 205c or 210c Calls above 196.67. Take 180p or 175p Puts below 186.67. Expected Move +/- $13.30

NVDA - Three Black Crows candle pattern close on the daily TF. We filled some of the gap below and still have more to fill below 225.08 down to 211.04 area. And we closed right below big supply zone. Take 235c Calls above 230.50. Take 220p Puts below 224.15. Expected Move +/- $7.18

SKX - Skechers just moved higher off support around $43.20. I believe we see a continuation of this move higher as the stock swung above its 50 daily MA yesterday as well implying bullish momentum.

FOLD - This stick moved above resistance around $13.62 after reporting earnings yesterday which is where shares topped out on January 13th. I believe we see a continuation of this move higher.

LSCC - The semiconductor stock reported better than expected earnings last week. I believe we should see a move higher above this $85.54 resistance level which is where shares topped out back in November of 2021.

It's a very long paper. So I made it into an audio book. Enjoy.

This is proof of how the markets move according the the FED. The FED is never wrong.

This is for the community, find the source to the original paper at the bottom, the YouTube video is the audio book summary. Enjoy.

**Audio Book**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQvDNUDKzpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQvDNUDKzpQ)

**Abstract:**

We provide evidence for a causal link between the US economy and the global financial cycle. Using intraday data, we show that US macroeconomic news releases have large and significant effects on global risky asset prices. Stock price indexes of 27 countries, the VIX, and commodity prices all jump instantaneously upon news releases. The responses of stock indexes co-move across countries and are large - often comparable in size to the response of the S&P 500. Further, US macroeconomic news explains on average 23 percent of the quarterly variation in foreign stock markets. The joint behavior of stock prices, bond yields, and risk premia suggests that systematic US monetary policy reactions to news do not drive the estimated effects. Instead, the evidence points to a direct effect on investor‚Äô risk-taking capacity. Our findings show that a byproduct of the United States' central position in the global financial system is that news about its business cycle has large effects on global financial conditions.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 60% and 78%. (Stats as of 2023-01-31)",hardyrekshin,37,1677729147.0

11fkslv,Tesla new drivetrain will have no rare earth metals - short MP Materials,"TL/DR - EVs currently need rare earth metals, MP materials makes rare earth metals. Thesis is to short $MP

During its investor day today, Tesla announced its new drivetrain will have no rare earth metals. This may not have been headline news, but this is a massive development for the EV industry. 

Little background: EVs, particularly the battery packs, typically require a large amount of rare earth oxides (REOs). Unsurprisingly, REOs are in short supply (‚Äúrare‚Äù), and can be not only costly but a massive bottleneck in the supply chain for EV manufacturers. Not only that, but until a few years ago, nearly all of the REO production was done in China.

Enter MP materials ($MP) the US based ‚Äúsavior‚Äù to the rare earth metal issue. They own the Mountain Pass mine in CA and went public via SPAC in 2020. They ran up and have continued to perform well based on the fact that they‚Äôre essentially the only western miner and producer of REOs. Currently at a $6B market cap, most of the hype around them has been around how they will be the key western supplier of EV materials.

Well, Tesla shifting to non REOs for their drivetrain will not only lower Teslas need for them, but all the other auto OEMs will now be looking to copycat this move to keep costs low. To be clear, EVs are not the only need for rare earth metals, but they were a huge part of the hype and bull case. 

For an already overvalued $6B mining company, Elon just out their entire future in jeopardy if he and the rest of the autos can get off of rare earths.

Disclosure: I am now short $MP

11fkqnv,Sell the RIP‚Ä¶ 3-1-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis and Recap,"Well after yet another day of high volatility, high IV and range bound movement ($3.31 total movement intraday) we are yet again still seeing sell the rip happen here in the market. Will this continue or will we see an upside push? 

One interesting thing to note now is that SPY and Futures are both officially in extreme bear momentum. Which means that we are going to need a bigger and more aggressive bounce in order to see a reversal upside. We would need to close over the daily 20ema and continue upward after that to convinced me of an upside reversal. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4rxy43puh7la1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4168786563e1a067dbad4a60bc58a5c929a16fa

Taking a look at the daily chart here you can see we have that nice 396.36 supply level that we established on Friday. With that being established we then broke out over it‚Ä¶ tested demand and rejected it at 400.6 and then came back down and now we are closing back under supply. This is very bearish in nature. 

I would suspect with this movement especially with the rejection and closure back under the daily 100ema today that we should continue to see a push down until we either establish a new demand or we bounce off 388.66 demand. We interestingly enough still have a very old supply level at 383.81 that has not been taken out yet. We could see a large push or large flash crash there eventually (think CPI or FOMC) to take that out before we go back up. 

Again I remain bearish overall until SPY closes over 400.6 and now until we close and HOLD over 396.36. 

The biggest bullish case here is that we establish a new demand in this 390 to 394 area over the next 2 days and that could set us up for a bigger push back to that 400.6 demand which would get us a daily 8, 20 and 200ema retest. From there though I still would suspect downside unless we are able to hold up there. WE also today turned Fridays 395.4 support level into resistance today which again just further confirms downside. 

I would actually like to be in some 14dte puts on SPY but the issue is that premiums are getting theta ate and chopped up with this high IV and these massive moves up before it finally retraces. 

Supply- 396.36 -> 383.81

Demand- 400.6 -> 388.66

Key SPY Support- 394.7 -> 393.6 -> 391.5 -> 390.1

Key Spy Resistance- 395.5 -> 396.3 -> 397.3 -> 397.8 -> 398.5

&#x200B;

I again remain far more bearish on futures than I do on SPY itself. What we have here yet again is a daily 8 and 100ema rejection on Futes. One thing to note here too is that we had established a demand at 3975‚Ä¶ broke over it‚Ä¶ established a new supply the very next day‚Ä¶ and then now we have rejected that supply level and lost/ closed under that demand. Which again as you can imagine is bearish in nature. 

The next bigger demand here to keep an eye on is 3915. Similarly with Spy until we realistically can close and hold a candle over 4020 supply I am not bullish on SPY and with futures also in extreme bear momentum we should look for upside pushes to sell the rip. We of course can play and does appear to be happening everyday the LOD bounces to retest resistance before falling lower. However, the risk to reward is low for such plays. 

Despite almost every day being a tight $3-$4 choppy annoying range‚Ä¶ at some point we are going to get a bigger breakout move and I will not risk being on either side of that. 

Supply- 3988 -> 4020

Demand- 3975 -> 3915

Key Futures Support- 3960 -> 3945 -> 3920 

Key Futures Resistance- 3968 -> 3975 -> 3990

Tesla is sitting in no mans land. I actually almost took some calls on it because of investor day tonight (its going on right now and let me tell you it‚Äôs a snooze fest)‚Ä¶. Speculation remains that a new model will be released here that is about 25k-30k‚Ä¶ lets see if that happens. 

From a technical stand point we are stuck between 194.25/ 196.3 demand and 207.7/214.23 supply. Essentially there is no play until we either establish a new supply below the current 207.7 one which would indicate the ceiling is get lower and we could look for a retest of 194-196 and possibly lower, or we get a new demand above 196.3 which would confirm that $2 range as massive support and that would push us back to that 207-214 range. Until that happens there is zero play. 

Interestingly enough looking at the last tesla investors day it had an 6%+ drop the following day‚Ä¶ 

Supply- 207.7 -> 214.24 -> 224.75  
 Demand- 196.29 -> 194.25

Key Tesla Support- 202.8 -> 201 -> 197.8 -> 196.3 -> 194.3

Key Tesla Resistance- 206.3 -> 207.7 -> 210.8 -> 214.2

Interestingly enough the VIX did not break down today but it did close a red day while SPY also closed a red day which is definitely not the normal way this market works. The VIX held the 20ema support here but did reject the daily 8ema. 

One interesting thing to note is that the last time the VIX was in this area was February 17th‚Ä¶ SPY had a LOD of 404.05 and a HOD of 407.51 that day. Currently with the VIX at the same level our LOD was 393.38 and HOD was 396.69.

What is the main point‚Ä¶ despite ‚Äúfear‚Äù not spiking we are seeing a market retracement.

I just realized I made a ton of trades today. I made 10 intraday trades (also closed 4 different longs) today vs. 6-7 trades/ day that I have been averaging. 

I had opened a slew of 30dte puts on Friday and pretty much Monday immediately regretted it. I thankfully was able to exit all but AMD and Nvidia today for profits but my bags were pretty heavy most of this week. The most frustrating thing was how these stocks would move up and down the way they did. 

Actually the most frustrating and kinda fascinating thing is that despite most of the stocks I was holding have decent drops over night/ intraday they did not gain as much value as I anticipated that they would. My SPY puts were the most frustrating. They closed ITM at about 6% red‚Ä¶ and with the morning opening and a 0.3%+ drop I had only gone from -6% to -3%... I have no idea what was going on with that. I ended up holding until the 2nd drop and then felt like I was winning just being able to exit. 

MSFT was the same was too‚Ä¶ closed down about 10-12% and with a -1% drop I had barely seen breakeven. Didn‚Äôt make a whole lot of sense to me. 

Something else that is funky this whole week is that the intraweek contracts so 3/2 and 3/3 spy options IV is extremely elevated. It goes from 3/3 puts having a 20% IV to the 5dte 3/6 puts having an IV of 15%. I noticed it earlier in the week and we still haven‚Äôt seen IV come down. Its like the week is pricing in a huge movement but its not happening. 

Overall though a good day of trading despite all the chop we had. Really only the bad part of the day was getting burnt in a call around 145pm that appeared to have a nice bounce coming up. Only to break a key demand so I exited early. I jumped into a put for the downside move and ended up getting stopped out on that big 2pm doji candle and then the next candle proceeded to dump. 

Outside of that this has been a pretty good week of trading.",DaddyDersch,65,1677710760.0

* **Historical move**: in the past 4 weeks what is the historical volatility (up and down, log variance of daily gains). 
* **Priced move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move. 
* **Call/put premium:** how much extra you are paying for the expected move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean they are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean they are ""expensive. 
* **What strike?** The at the money strike. 
* **What expiration?** 4 weeks away (3/31)

11fb6dk,Why I'm getting CRM calls for earnings today,"Salesforce (CRM) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Mar 1. The cloud-based software maker‚Äôs fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation.

With hybrid work trending right now, there's been a massive and continuing adoption of software-as-a-service-based platforms all over the world. This drives the demand for Salesforce‚Äôs cloud-based solutions. Salesforce‚Äôs diverse cloud offerings are likely to have helped expand its clientele, fueling the top line.

Salesforce‚Äôs initiatives to capitalize on the overseas demand for cloud-based applications are anticipated to have bolstered the top line during the period in discussion. Further, the improved customer experience is anticipated to have aided the cloud segment.

Salesforce‚Äôs ability to provide an integrated solution for customers‚Äô business problems is expected to have been the key driver. CRM‚Äôs Customer 360 Truth platform, which helps connect the data from sales, service, marketing and commerce and build a single Salesforce ID for each customer, is likely to have boosted its performance. Also, its focus on AI and the substantial progress in its Einstein Analytics platform make it optimistic about the upcoming quarterly results.

11f91eh,Wayfair (W) - too late for puts?,"Is anyone still on this sinking ship? Last week, Wayfair reported their Q4 and year-end numbers, and it was not pretty. Revenue declined 4.6% YoY in Q4. The company's operations lost $330 million on $3.1 billion in revenue, compared to only losing $196 million in Q4 2021. And for the full year, W sunk into a black hole of $1.3 billion operating loss, compared to only $131 million in 2021.

The train wreck continues: Active customers declined a 19% YoY in 2022. Perhaps not surprisingly, W lost $12.54/share, compared to only losing $1.26/share in 2021 after having a stellar year during the pandemic when it rose by $1.93/share in 2020.

**A look at financials**: At the end of 2022, W had $1.27 billion in cash/short-term investments, down from $2.39 billion at the end of 2021. Including receivables, W only has $1.5 billion in potential liquidity, compared to $1.2 billion in payables. And at their current quarterly burn rate, W could be insolvent by the end of Q1 2023. Some could argue W is already technically insolvent with a $2.5 billion negative book value.

Despite all of this, management and employee stock-based compensation was a whopping $513 million, compared to only $322 million in 2022 and $276 million in 2020 (the last time W generated profits). Seems the way the company punishes poor performance is by compensating with its rapidly deteriorating stock options. 

Both  Wayfair and Overstock suffered in 2022 as the furniture sector continues to normalize from the high spending seen during the Covid-era lockdowns. 

**My position**: I've got 20P contracts expiring 5/19/23 but if somehow you don't want to pick a direction or you actually think W can turn things around, you could turn it into a bull put spread. Max gain: $237 on $3760 investment.  Watch out if W drops below $22.50, you could get caught bagholding shares.

11f62ge,ISM Manufacturing 47.7 vs 48 expected. Prices 51.3 vs 45.1 expected.,"TLDR: Goods inflation INCREASED, rather than decreasing as expected.

Slightly lower than expected 47.7 vs 48 expected. ISM numbers any number below 50 means contraction and above 50 means expansion. Manufacturing has been in contraction or hovering at contraction mode for some time now.

Inflation prices for goods are proxied as ISM Manufacturing Prices Paid, which came in at expansion mode (51.3) vs 45.1 expected. So inflation pressures in February for the manufacturing sector didn't go down, but rather INCREASE. This might mean goods inflation is picking up again.

New Orders are a proxy for demand increased to 47 from 42.5 last month, so better, but still in contraction mode.

Employment at 49.1, lower than last month's 50.6, so employment is slowing.

It looks like since demand is increasing, companies are hiking prices to make their profit margins return back to their desired levels.

**Some comments from the report:**

*‚ÄúNew orders are still strong; however, we continue to experience price increases (although at a slower rate than a year ago), which we have not accounted for in this year‚Äôs budget. Restoring lost margin due to cost increases is a top priority.‚Äù \[Fabricated Metal Products\]*

11f4z2k,"Insider Trading Weekly Update #028: $DASH CEO, CFO Dump Company Stock, Largest Trades Overall + By Market Sector From The Past Week","GM. Welcome to March.

**TL;DR** \- Insider purchases jumped this week (+116%), notably due to a series of buys made by Mubadala Investment Co Pjsc into Recursion Pharmaceuticals ($RXRX / Biotechnology). Otherwise, there was a general drop in activity, with 753 insider transactions (-26%) filed by 643 corporate insiders (down from 859 the prior week).

Below are some notable sales from insiders:

* Andy Fang, a Director at Doordash ($DASH / Internet & Direct Marketing Retail), **sold his entire position** in a $7.8M sale on Feb 21st
* Tony Xu, the CEO of Doordash, **sold his entire position** in a $7.8M sale on Feb 21st
* Keith Jensen, the CFO & Chief Accounting Officer of Fortinet ($FTNT / Software), decreased his stake by 95.56% in a $5.9M sale on Feb 23rd
* Scott Donnelly, the Chairman, President & CEO of Textron Inc ($TXT / Aerospace & Defense) decreased his position by 24.55% with a $16.3M sale on Feb 21st
* David Powers, the President & CEO of Deckers Outdoor Corp ($DECK / Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods) sold 28.05% of his stake for $14.4M on Feb 21st

And some notable buys from insiders:

* R A Walker, a Director at ConocoPhillips ($COP / Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels), increased their position by 21.05% with a $494K purchase on Feb 22nd

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from $29.8M to $64.5M (+116%)
* Sales decreased from $1.9B to $1.3B (-31%)
* Transactions decreased from 1,014 to 753 (-26%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s decreased from 452 to 354 (-22%)
   * Net buyers increased from 28 to 37 (+32%)
   * Net sellers decreased from 424 to 317 (-25%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s decreased from 859 to 643 (-25%)
   * Net buyers decreased from 48 to 45 (-6%)
   * Net sellers decreased from 811 to 598 (-26%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **February 20th - February 24th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of ‚ÄúP‚Äù or ‚ÄúS‚Äù. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **February 13th - February 17th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

11f3qfa,Tesla and TSLA,"I have written about TSLA before. They are in a very strong position. The only thing holding TSLA back is that Elon has apparently gone insane.

Tesla is still the strongest EV maker by far. They are sold out for months and months depending on the model and market. Their energy division grows in the background, and nobody notices. Other EV makers talk big, but do not have the battery supply chains. They can't make enough EVs to matter.

(See Back Ground posts below. For some reason, Reddit won't let me post the links. )

What really matters is the PE ratio and growth. I have written about this before in the above posts. Right now, it is about 57. Which really isn't that high for a company that is doing such huge growth. They made 1.3 million vehicles in 2022. But they are already as of now, at a production rate of 1.7million vehicles. By the end of 2023, it will be even higher. A company doing a 35% to 40% YoY growth rate is not at all high to have a 57 PE ratio.

&#x200B;

**Edit: Here is the TLDR,**

**6 million cars per year leads to a $2.1 Trillion Market Cap with a very reasonable PE ratio.** 

**---6million cars per year x margin of $12K per car = 72Billion.** 

**---72B x reasonable PE ratio of 30 = $ 2.1Trllion**

**This ignores supercharger fees, robotaxi nonsense, energy sector, solar, subscriptions, etc**

**(They already have very good margins on their cars. Reuters says $15K per car already)**

&#x200B;

From a Post in 2021

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Tesla Stock still has huge growth potential.

Listen up fellow apes. I will try to make this short and simple. I believe TSLA is headed towards a $2T Market Cap.

**PE Ratio**

The PE Ratio measures current share price relative to its per-share earnings. This reflects how much an investor is willing to pay for earnings.

For a company not rapidly expanding, a normal P/E ratio is around 20:1. The average PE for the S&P is something like 15.

We have all read about TSLA having an insanely high PE ratio in the past. That was before they started making over $1B per quarter.

Now the PE ratio is lower, but still very high.

TSLA is currently around a PE of 112 for forward earnings. The stock costs \~$650 per share. And the earnings per share were $1.45 for Q2.

So 650/ (1.45 x 4 quarters) = A forward PE of about 110.

(I am multiplying by the most recent Q2 and assuming the earnings are the same going forward for the sake of simplicity in this example)

Another way is to take annual earnings and the total market cap of the company. Their recent earnings were about $1.14B in Q2. So assume $4.56Billion for the next year.

$622B market cap / 4.56B annual earnings = PE ratio of \~135

This is with them making around 200,000 vehicles per quarter in Q2 2020. Or an annualized rate of just over 800,00 vehicles per year. Just doing an average of 1.14Billion / 200,000 gives us about $5,000 ""per car"". This ignores the energy sectors and software, solar, etc. Just a point of reference for an average.

**Future**

Does anyone expect Tesla to be standing still for the next few years?

Of course not.

With Berlin and Texas coming online, Tesla may reach 900,000 cars this year. In 2022 they will likely be well over 1.5million cars per year. So let's assume that by 2024 they are making 3 million cars per year.

3,000,000 cars x $5,000 per car = $15Billion per year in earnings.

How about with $8,000 per car?

=$24Billion

$24Billion x 30 = $720Billion Market Cap

How about a PE ration of 50. Since this seems like something investors have had no trouble tolerating over the life of TSLA's stock.

$24B x 50 = $1.2T Market Cap.

Let's try that again for 2028

Assume 6million cars per year and profits of $12,000 per car as efficiencies ramp up across all sectors.

This gives an annual earnings of $72B.

((-Again, this sort of ignores the energy sector, software potential, etc.

\-Just the $10/month that Tesla charges for premium connectivity will become a high margin revenue generator. Around 2023 or 2024 Tesla will have about 5million cars on the road being charged the monthly cost.

$120/year x 5,000,000 cars = $600,000,000 per year in mostly profit.

\-The Supercharger costs to other Automakers could also become a huge revenue generator. ))

**A PE ratio of 30 on $72B is $2.1T**

This would be a stock price around $2200 per share.

If Investors are willing to tolerate a higher PE, then the Market Cap could hit 2T much sooner.

**Other Notes**

It is worth considering that if the stock gets into the Low $1,000s, Tesla may split it again. When it was announced last time there was a massive increase in the stock price before the split. It went from the low 1,000s to the mid $2,000s. The Mid $2,000s would be a Market Carp \~ $2T.

Edit: No matter what you think about 'FSD', it should be easy for everyone to accept that once Tesla gets FSD approved in a single jurisdiction, the stock will also jump through the roof. It doesn't matter if it will be in 2022, 2023, or 20XX, etc. I left that out since it is a whole separate discussion. And is not needed for my math of a $2T market cap.

Don't listen to me. Ignore my assumptions. Invest in Banana futures.

Another Older Post

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Greetings fellow simians and proto-simians,

I wrote a post a while back that got some interest about being long TSLA.

I won't rehash the $2T market cap position. This post will go over various points of Tesla's advantages or disadvantages in support of a $2T market cap and overall value as a company and stock. HODL until 2024, stock price or year.

This may come across as the rantings of a mad-man. But I will try to make it coherent.

Notes:

1. All this will be done without a realization of FSD. That will have a huge change on stock price as soon as it is approved in a single jurisdiction.
2. Also, Please note, that once TSLA gets into the low thousands, another Stock Split is likely. Last time a stock split was announced the price went from the low $1,000s to the low $2,000s by the time of the Split.

**Tesla Advantages**

A) Tesla has more battery supply contracts.No other company can come close to Tesla on quantity or KWHr/$ cost for battery packs.(VW has substantial contracts. But even then, it seems unlikely their vendors will be able to actually obtain enough raw material supply.)For Example, the moron Executives at Ford did not even realize that the EV Battery Supply for the world was already contracted out for Years.

B) Software/Over the Air........In 2021, not even VW can figure this out.

C) Software based UI

Less buttons, cables, supply chain.The cost is in the supply chain.People think the minimalist interior of the 3 and Y are driven by Elon's ego. But really, the less stuff = less costs. Less install, less holding and supply costs, less wires, etc etc.The lack of traditional air vents might look cool, but it is really about having less parts.

D) Supercharger Network.Tesla has the largest charging network in the World. This is a huge revenue generator and asset for Tesla Owners.

E) Tesla Sells more EVs in North America/US than all the other OEMs put together...... x 4.[https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020](https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020)

F) If you count road trip capable EVs, (can charge fast enough) Tesla sells over 90%.The crappy leafs and bolt type EVs cannot charge fast enough for a road trip.

G) People hate car dealerships more than the Dentist for a lot of reasons. People like buying things online and not having to interact with other humans. Besides just being able to order online, with a Tesla, you can see the actual price of the actual car. That is the price. It is nearly impossible to get an actual out-the-door price from a legacy dealer until the final paperwork for the car.As consumers become more and more aware of this, it will be a sales advantage for Tesla.

H) The potential EV market is huge.

Every Dinosaur OEM is always stunned when their EV offerings sell out in minutes. People want EVs. Tesla is not really competing against other EVs. They are taking sales of dinosaur ICE sales.

G) Tesla Engineers in different areas work together. In a normal OEM world, the radiator team does not work with the regen-break team. Tesla staff do work together. So there is less bulk and unneeded parts in Tesla products.

H) The ""Model 2"" is likely to be announced soon. This is the cheaper compact EV expected to be made and marketed in China.

I) All Teslas are capable of Road Trips.(Big Enough Battery, Efficient enough Mileage, Fast Enough Charge Rate miles per minutes charging). Not to mention robust enough charging network.

J). Right now, it is very difficult in the lower 48 to be more than 75 miles from a Tesla Supercharger. It is also very difficult to be on an expressway and be more than 50miles from a Supercharger. This is a huge asset and Tesla is already there now. Not in a few years.[https://supercharge.info/map](https://supercharge.info/map)

K) Seamless Supercharging.Have you ever used a non-Tesla fast charger? The process is awful. The stalls might be broken, they don't handshake with the car, the payment doesn't work etc. They are in shopping parking lots instead of along major travel routes.

**Disadvantages**

A) Non-FSD chip Supply(Shouldn't affect Tesla more than any other OEM. But may have more airtime in the media due to FUD spreaders)

B) FUD in the media. Example: Jalopnik has a huge audience. But they can't print an accurate story about Tesla if their lives depended on it. Reading the Jalopnik comments on a Tesla Story is like listening to conspiracy rants from the Capitol Rioters. Tesla gets them clicks. Printing something sensational gets clicks. Here is an example. Many outlets, including Jalopnik, recently reported that Tesla finally made a profit without Reg Credits (pollution emission credits). Except that Tesla has made a profit in the past without Reg Credits. It is hard to believe someone writing an article could be this bad at math and research. Taxes are paid on income from Reg Credits. So you have to subtract both the income AND the taxes on that income if you want to know Tesla's Quarterly balance sheet without Reg Credits. \*\* Math Below

**Other OEMs are mostly Morons**

A) Ford has paired with SK to make a factory that can make 125GWHrs per year.....in 2025.This is a decent amount of battery supply. But again, this is really only enough Batteries for <2 million cars annually...by 2025. And this is if they can even get the supply contracts for raw materials. Tesla Will be making 2 Million electric cars per year by the middle of 2023 if not sooner.

B) Most other electric cars in North America are still compliance nonsense like the Bolts.

B1) The Bolts are really just there to sell Silverados. The Bolts can't fast charge enough for a road trip. The Bolts catch fire and have recalls that aren't reported much in the news. Could you imagine if Tesla told people to stop charging their vehicles indoors or unattended? There would be articles calling for Blood.

B2) The MachE is a good car spec wise. (It really is a compliance car for the EU though)But was clearly designed by a company that is Silo'd. Meaning the engineering groups do not work together. Sandy Munro - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU)

B3) There are only a handful of non-Tesla electric cars in North America in models and total quantity that can actually charge fast enough for non-local driving. Most of these are pricey. It is Q3 2021. Selling an EV that can only charge at 150KW peak charge rate is a joke. Even the ID4 is more like 125KW.

C) GM appears to be MoronsThese people paired with Nikola. How dumb could a company be?Anyone who follows the EV space knew that Nikola was vaporware long before the latest fraud accusations.

[https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/)

D) Tesla is sold out for Months. (2022 forfor some)This is a great problem to have in most circumstances. If you want a Tesla in 2021, you should be ordering it now.

E) There are something like 1.2 million Cybertruck reservations.

Even if only half of those turn into actual orders, that is still $40 Billion in revenue.

Presumably more and more orders will come in once deliveries start being made and people see them in person.[https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html](https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html)

For comparison, the F150 lighting has about 150,000 reservations/orders. Which is great. Except that Ford has no battery supply to deliver most of these for the next several years.

F. Toyota is still Gaslighting us about Hydrogen.

[https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/)

G. People think a common parts bin is an asset. It mostly is not. If you are designing common EVs, then yes sure, a common parts bin makes sense. But what it really has done to most offerings from Dinosaur OEMs has forced decisions that were based on the part; not the design need. See Sandy Munro videos for examples. But the MachE is a good example.

**Ranting about Hydrogen Fuel Cells**

ZZ) Hydrogen is for snake oil for Gaslighting morons. Most people think that Hydrogen is burned in Fuel cells cars. HFCs actually work like this: You put a bunch of energy into making, storing, and transporting hydrogen, then later, you get a small small amount of that energy back. Each KG of Hydrogen created will produce about 9KG of C02. (before accounting for storage and transport)[https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/)

\*\* TSLA Q3 2020 Example

[https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/)

People who spread that myth are not recognizing that taxes are paid on reg credit income.Reg credits have taxes paid on them.

Less Income = Less Taxes.Income from Reg Credits is taxed.

555 income before taxes186 paid in taxes= about 34% tax rate

If people claim that they only made a profit from regulatory credits, then subtract out regulatory credits AND the taxes paid on them.555 - 397= \~158

158 \* tax rate of 34% or so = 53milli in taxes

158-53mil in taxes = over 100mil in profit.

The point being they have made a profit in previous quarters without reg credits. It is just that most journalists are too lazy to understand math.

As always, don't listen to me. Do your own research.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 60% and 78%. (Stats as of 2023-01-31)",hardyrekshin,39,1677646656.0

11enu76,How can this be legal to do? $NVDA,I will start this off by saying I'm short $NVDA so the mixed shelf actually helps my position. But isn't the   SEC allowing them to do a 10 billion mixed shelf setting a really bad precedence. What's to stop a CEO/CFO that gets stock options in the future from announcing a 15 billion buyback since buybacks don't have a time frame it doesn't matter how long it takes them to complete it say this in itself causes the stock to pump 20%. Then they start to do a very small portion of the buyback say 3 billion over 2 quarters which at an average of 150 per share is around 20 million shares and reporting those buybacks along with pumping causes another 25% raise you're now up 45% in 180 days. After those 180 day and being up 45% you do a mixed shelf for say 10 billion and with the increased priced you selling at an average of 200 now increasing the shares buy 50 million. So from the start you now have increased the outstanding shares by 30 million with raising 6 billion in capital. Well this announcement and selling the shares will cause the price to fall say 15% to around $180. Now with the price falling and still having to buy back 12 billion worth you wait for the next quarter to start buying back again slowly so you don't trigger the price to increase and buy back 1 billion at and average of 166 taking back 6 million shares. Total increase is now 24 million shares. Say your price falls all the way back to years low at $100 and you do a very large buyback that quarter of $6 billion at an average of around $115 buying back 52 million shares. Now you've decreased your share count by 28 million shares from the start and it hasn't cost you a dime because everything was from the mixed shelf. Now you only have to buyback 5 billion from the original announcement. Well while all of this was going on you have been getting stock options so say you owned 8% of the company from the start with buying the shares back it's now increased your position to 10% without having to risk anything on your part. Isn't this just as bad as someone pumping a stock to just dump it on other people? It's basically a very large pump and dump. This is all especially since all the insider selling the last month going on. This sounds to me like it's just a lawsuit waiting to happen. Next thing you know is they are going to let the price drop so everyone who sold shares can buy them back for cheaper just to turn around and cancel the mixed shelf.,SupraTrbo,7,1677627654.0
11enrfy,"Minutes of the Board's Discount Rate Meetings from January 23 and February 1, 2023","#### 

https://preview.redd.it/bqttb7v0m0la1.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7bb47684abe6a448c2fe1b710ee5ca03ca506486

#### Summarized Key Points

* Federal Reserve Bank directors reported steady economic activity in their Districts but with uneven sectors: **neutral**
* Some directors expect inflation rate, which remains elevated, to slowly moderate in 2023: **bullish**
* Directors of two Federal Reserve Banks favored maintaining primary credit rate at 4.5%: **neutral**
* FOMC raised target range for federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.5% to 4.75% effective February 2, 2023: **bearish**
* Board approved raising interest rate paid on reserve balances from 4.4% to 4.65% also effective February 2, 2023: **bearish**
* Calculation of federal funds rate every two weeks as the average of daily effective rate and rate on 3-month CDs over previous 14 days rounded to nearest 5 basis points: **neutral**
* Secretary authorized to inform Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Reserve Banks on establishment of primary credit rate at 4.75%: **neutral**

So we have 2 bearish points 1 bullish point 4 neutral points. Showing us the **FOMC is sounding more neutral and bearish** in todays release of the Minutes of the Board's discount rate meetings from January 23 and February 1, 2023

#### Quick Summary

Federal Reserve Bank directors reported steady economic activity with unevenness across sectors, and some expected inflation to slowly moderate in 2023. Two directors favored maintaining the primary credit rate at 4.5%. The FOMC decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.5-4.75%, and the interest rate paid on reserve balances was raised from 4.4% to 4.65%, both effective February 2, 2023. The Secretary was authorized to inform the Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Reserve Banks about the establishment of a primary credit rate of 4.75%.

#### Explained for Everyone

The Federal Reserve is an organization that helps control money in the United States. They recently made some changes to interest rates that could affect how much people can borrow and how much they have to pay back.

Some people at the Federal Reserve said that the economy is doing okay, but some parts are not doing as well as others. They also said that prices might not go up as fast in the future.

The Federal Reserve raised the ""federal funds rate"" by a little bit. This is like a price tag for money that banks borrow from each other. They also made it so that banks get a little bit more money for keeping their money in the Federal Reserve.

The Federal Reserve also told some other banks that they could charge a certain amount of money if other banks borrow money from them. This amount of money is called the ""primary credit rate"". The Federal Reserve said that these banks can charge 4.75% interest if someone wants to borrow money from them.

Overall, these changes could affect how much money people can borrow and how much they have to pay back. It might also affect how much things cost in the future.

We have seen credit deteriorating in the auto loan space according to a federal governor who spoke at Harvard yesterday which can be read [here](https://tweetsift.substack.com/p/ai-summarizes-a-speech-by-governor).

#### Use this information to make informed decisions about your trading strategy. 

Based on the summarized key points, it appears that the **FOMC** is **sounding** more **neutral and bearish**. Traders should keep an eye on economic indicators such as inflation and credit deterioration in the auto loan space, as these could impact the Federal Reserve's decisions about interest rates. Remember, they want a SLOW down.

The FED's recent decision to raise interest rates and make it more expensive for banks to borrow money from each other could impact borrowing and lending, which could affect the stock market and other markets. Traders should keep an eye on these changes and adjust their trading strategies accordingly.

Traders should monitor economic indicators and be prepared to adjust their strategies based on the Federal Reserve's decisions and actions. Don‚Äôt let 0 DTE fool you.",the-tweetsift-report,6,1677627463.0

Actually the most impressive thing is the fact that the final one minute candle dropped a total of $1.2. 

To me it seemed like markets were starting to forget about the whole 50bps hike thing and CPI being HOT‚Ä¶ However, they were kindly reminded today and that seems to have fueled this sell off here today. 

With markets reminded of 50bps we could see a small continuation sell off tomorrow.

Taking a look at SPY here you can see we have a really nice black bear channel going here. There is also a tighter more aggressive bear channel (red) inside of that. That could very well be a falling wedge. If that is a falling wedge then resistance for bulls to break for an upside push would be 397.4 tomorrow. That level coincidentally enough was MAJOR support almost all day long. 

The biggest things to note here is that tomorrow when markets open the daily 8ema will cross below the daily 50/200ema for the first time in over a month. Not only that but today we attempted ot break over the daily 200ema and couldn‚Äôt even touch it. Despite bouncing off the 100ema most of the day and yesterday we also closed below that. 

I still am eyeing 390 here and hold to that until SPY closes back over 400. We also have an established supply level at 396.42 that we did break back and close under today. This level could turn itself into nice resistance here. We have a large gap on supply back down to 383.81 and upside to 414/415.23. After establishing demand at 400.6 on 2/23 we retested that yesterday and rejected there. We should with that rejection seek on next demand at 388.66 unless we can establish a new demand this week first. 

Supply- 396.42 -> 383.81

Demand- 400.62 -> 388.66

Key SPY Support- 396.3 -> 395.4 -> 393.6 -> 391.44

Key SPY Resistance- 397.3 -> 398.5 -> 400 -> 400.6

Taking a look at ES futures here we actually have an even more bearish looking chart than Spy. I said I was worried that we COULD see a double bottom off that 3975 and that could push us up and that was in the back of my mind. However, bears struck back with another daily 8ema rejection, crossing the daily 8ema below the 50/200ema and closing under the daily 100ema. Now only that but we have a bearish engulfing daily candle here. 

Demand was established at 3975 on Friday which could have provided a bigger push up. However, we were not able to the the momentum up and with extreme bear momentum down the 8ema rejected us nicely here. With a presumable close below 3975 here the next target is 3915 demand. 

However, Supply wise we had a previous level at 4020 and yesterdays candle resistance now becomes new demand at 3988. With a rejection off supply and also losing demand here I am very much so bearish on futures and I am looking for that 3915/3920 area to be touched. I remain bearish as long as futures is under 4020. 

Supply- 3988 -> 4020 

Demand- 3975 -> 3915 

Key Futures Support- 3965 -> 3945 -> 3920

Key Futures Resistance- 3975 -> 3990 -> 4000 -> 4008 -> 4020

Tesla had a surprisingly weak showing today. I would have expected more strength today leading into investor day. However, after establishing a supply zone at 207.7 yesterday it attempted to push back to the previous supply of 214.24 and was unable to. With that failure we should start looking for a push down to demand near 196.3. However, with the tsla event tomorrow after hours this could go either way. 

Supply- 207.7 -> 214.24 -> 224.75

Demand- 196.29 -> 164.18

Key Tesla Support- 205.6 -> 202.1 -> 197.8

Key Tesla Resistance- 210.7 -> 214.2 -> 219.2

Kinda surprisingly here is the fact that the VIX did not spike when we had that massive EOD sell off. It id recoil a little bit eod and bounced off its daily 20ema and closed under its daily 8ema‚Ä¶ but with a sell off of that size I would have expected more bounce there. That could come tomorrow though. One thing I did note that besides Friday the PC ratio is very low this week on Spy.

11ek6i5,S&P 500 analysis.,"BEFORE YOU READ

Now i know what your going to say ‚Äúthis regard is using crayons to predict the market!‚Äù However, I want to clarify that the patterns I will be comparing with the S&P 500 are not drawn but rather based on past price action. While some may argue that the past cannot be compared to the present , these four patterns have consistently demonstrated similar behaviors. I have yet to find any patterns that contradict them, although there may be additional patterns that I have not yet discovered. This analysis is based on data from the year 2000 to present, and these examples serve to illustrate my point.

The chart is in the weekly candles and all of the patterns are from the S&P 500.

First off, we have a cyan pattern that occurred between February 2010 and September 2010. It suggests a potential 5% downturn from the current price, which is expected to occur in mid-May.

This pattern is perhaps the most accurate, since the pattern closely mirrors the actual price action

https://preview.redd.it/uh7vweuowzka1.png?width=1647&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c85a891542775caf017cc2d5e77d994587c97f2a

The second pattern in purple is from March 2002 to March 2003, and it suggests a potential 6% downturn from the current price, which is also expected to occur in mid-May.

https://preview.redd.it/qgrkpspqwzka1.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=33d5507ec74bf7233e38d6c011cde2fbb3292917

The third pattern in red is from October 2007 to September 2008, and it suggests a potential 14% downturn from the current price, which is also expected to occur in mid-May.

I am aware that this pattern is during the housing market crash, but the current price behavior indicates parallels with the crash of 2008.

https://preview.redd.it/w15qe95swzka1.png?width=1645&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=948397c5e60e5bf786b96f1f826d23518c1ed1c1

The fourth pattern in yellow is from August 2000 to December 2002, and it suggests a potential 16% downturn from the current price, which is also expected to occur in mid-May.

Again I don't believe it will experience such a significant drop, but it does exhibit similar patterns to the crash of 2002.

https://preview.redd.it/umetnokuwzka1.png?width=1638&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=033d180934dfa5d623b0a6fbfd632570606635fc

I have discovered that there are several patterns similar to this in the S&P 500, but I am unsure if there is any pattern that does not suggest a decline in mid-May. Despite my search, I have not been able to find any such pattern, and every potential pattern I came across indicated a decline until mid-May. Therefore, I am uncertain of the extent of the potential decline, but if my analysis is correct, it seems likely that the decline will halt in mid-May. But if I had to say I think that the cyan pattern is very likely to happen.

Magnesium metal is extremely light: it is 75% lighter than steel, 50% lighter than titanium, and 33% lighter than aluminum. It has the highest known damping capacity of any structural metal, capable of withstanding 10x more than aluminum, titanium, or steel!  Many large automotive companies have already replaced steel and aluminum with magnesium in various parts of their products to lighten the load. They already own land in Nevada, where they are working to move their operations already in test production and plan to ship to ports on the west coast. Magnesium alloys are a much needed strong, light weight metal in today's industries. Just think of how much further cars, trains, & planes could go by reducing their weight from heavy metals! The US needs a clean supply of magnesium and magnesium alloys from here at home and not rely on other dirty processes in countries like China.

Emerson is bidding $53 a share, up from an initial $48 offer, and in response NI adopted a poison pill. The majority shareholder and NI founder Dr. T with a \~28% holding is in favor of the acquisition.

Now, NATI has been hovering on the 50-54 range ever since, but I noticed an uptick in options volume today, 6K for March'17 50C and 6K for March'17 50P.

It might be a dud, or it might be an insider playing a straddle. If it's a straddle is it long or short? I would guess this is a long straddle, expecting either a retracted bid (sending NATI <$47) or the arrival of a new bidder for >$53, both resulting in a profit. The high break-even is very close to the $53 announced bid.

However, there is also the question of why would an insider play a straddle instead of picking a direction if he/she really knows something.

11eep22,"Tesla new plant in Monterrey, Mexico confirmed","Rumors have been circulating for at least a couple months, but confirmed now by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador: Tesla is set to build a brand new plant in Monterrey, Mexico. This is a huge boost for Mexico, as it's trying to establish itself as a hub for investment by bringing manufacturing capacity to North America and away from Asia, thanks to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lopez Obrador revealed that he had a call with Elon Musk on Monday, and they came to an agreement that will create lots of jobs and bring in a considerable investment. The President had previously expressed concerns over water shortages, but Musk was receptive and has accepted Mexico's proposals.

This investment is a big test for Mexico's President, who has a reputation for being a bit of a resource nationalist. Some companies have been unsettled by his efforts to strengthen state control of the energy market at the expense of private capital. But with Mexico receiving its highest foreign direct investment inflows for years in 2022, it's clear that the country's lower-cost and skilled workforce is making it a global center for the car industry.

We don't know all the details just yet, but Lopez Obrador said Tesla will likely give us more information tomorrow. It's all happening during Musk's ""Investor Day,"" where he'll outline his ""Master Plan Part Three.""  (source: [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mexican-president-says-tesla-build-143052963.html))

Not sure whether to buy calls or puts on Musk? Here's a strategy so you don't have to be married to one direction. With this ratio spread you can make up to 14% (20% annualized) AND still be protected if TSLA dips. TSLA can fall to $125 (40% drop) before losing any capital.

Both days showed average volume. 24M on Monday and 19M Tuesday(the 10-day average daily volume is 23M), so it does not seem like the shorts have been covering.

I would think we would have to see 45M plus in volume per day to indicate any substantial short covering, so Monday and Tuesday increases may just be bargain hunters after the target price doubling by CitiGroup from $5.5 to $11/share, or market value reassessment after digesting the earnings call.",BriantheGardener,3,1677605083.0

11e9osd,Charlie Munger is an off-course weather balloon.,"&#x200B;

Article taken from Planet Crypto.

&#x200B;

Chinese authorities have claimed that suspiciously pro-China investor, Charlie Munger, is not a spy but an off-course weather balloon.

Just days after Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, called for the U.S. to copy China in its ban on bitcoin, China denied he was an infiltrator, and insisted that he was another balloon flying in American airspace measuring the weather.

‚ÄúThis is an innocent coincidence‚Äù, said Chinese spokesperson, Li R Big-Fat. ‚ÄúWhat may look to Western eyes like a 121 year-old man in a suit and glasses is nothing more than an old weather balloon ‚Äì or as we call it in China, an old wind-bag. The suit and glasses this weather balloon happens to be wearing are also an innocent coincidence. We can only assume that at some point it must have drifted through a clothesline and picked them up. It must have innocently drifted through an optician‚Äôs too. Does that sound convincing?‚Äù

U.S. authorities trying to work out whether Munger is a Communist spy or an experimental weather balloon have taken him in for analysis but are so far none the wiser. ‚ÄúHe is very interested in the weather, but so are most grandpa‚Äôs‚Äù, said FBI agent, Biff Federales. ‚ÄúHe also carries a little red book, but that turned out to be his bus pass.‚Äù",byteaw,66,1677596320.0

11e81oy,Morning Briefing üåû Feb 28th 2023 (Let's see if we're right again!),"Good morning! [Last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11dcz18/morning_briefing_feb_27th_2023/).

This morning, stock futures were little changed as investors prepared for the final trading day of the month. Slight gap up today, but that 4022 area remains the key resistance & strong hold for the bears. As long as we are below this key level, we need to keep the expectations of playing longs to a minimal. This area has been rejected many many times in both pre market & regular trading hours. Keep in mind we have some data coming out both 15 & 30 mins into market so this will cause some volatility. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 31 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures also climbed 0.1% each. Zoom Video jumped 6.4% on strong earnings, while Target rose 1.3% after reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial average rose 72.17 points or 0.22%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 0.31% and 0.63%, respectively. February has been a pullback month, and the major indexes are on pace for their second negative month in three. Investors also await consumer confidence data, wholesale inventories, Chicago PMI, and the S&P Case-Shiller home prices index.

Overall Market Outlook: 

SPY - Bearish candle close on the daily TF. We reclaimed the 50MA on the daily. And we are squeezing setting up for a move on the hourly TF. Expected Move +/- $3.20

QQQ - Bearish candle close on the daily TF. We reclaimed the 50WMA on the daily. And we are squeezing on the hourly TF. Expected Move +/- $3.00

Watchlist: 

TSLA - Bullish candle close on the daily TF. We reclaimed the 8Ema and 200WMA on the daily. And we now have a gap to fill below 201.26 down to 197.67 area. And we broke out the symmetrical triangle to the upside. Take 225c or 235c Calls above 213.67 or take puts below 203.33. Take the 190p or 185p. Expected Move +/- $15.66

NVDA- Bearish candle close on the daily TF. We have a double top on the daily as well. We still have a big gap to fill below. And we brokeout the bullflag we were in. Take 245c or 250c Calls above 238. Puts below 233 BNH. Take the 225p or 220p. Expected Move +/- $10.52

AI - AI is printing a bull flag after seeing the 50 daily MA cross above its 200 daily MA last week which implies bullish momentum. I believe if we get a break of this bull flag we could see a larger move higher for the stock.

SPY - The S&P 500 Looks to be holding its 200 daily MA around $392, we saw a bounce off this crucial daily MA yesterday. We got a golden cross back in February which is a very bullish sign for momentum.

WDAY - Workday reported better than expected earnings and is now falling down to support around $180, I believe we could see a bounce off this $180 level and a sustained move higher for this outperforming stock.",LogicalAnswerk,26,1677594329.0

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 60% and 78%. (Stats as of 2023-01-31)",hardyrekshin,23,1677545245.0

Average open over the last 7 trading days is +/- 0.83%. That‚Äôs pretty dang impressive.. 

Today was probably one of my favor intraday SPY patterns‚Ä¶ the classic 123 rollercoaster.. I have talked about this numerous times but essentially a 123 rollercoaster is 1) the initial move in this case the dump from 401.29 to 398.26‚Ä¶ 2) the recovery in this case that is the pump from 398.26 to 399.51 and then finally 3) the final bigger push past initial low‚Ä¶ in this case that‚Äôs the EOD push to 397.2 area. Its actually really refreshing to see this pattern play out today as this is how SPY used to behave and generally behaves in a healthy market‚Ä¶ these massive V bottoms and Massive LOD to HOD reversals are NOT the normal even though 2022 wants us to believe they are. This is healthy and refreshing to see especially on a bear trend day‚Ä¶

Despite the pretty impressive 0.9% green open and the push over 401 this morning the bears were able to capitalize once again. This honestly reminds me of the last 2 months but in reverse‚Ä¶ how many times did we see major morning dumps and red pre markets only for the bulls by EOD to take it green or at least recover most of the loss? We are seeing the same thing here‚Ä¶ and honestly today is a VERY bearish candle closure‚Ä¶ 

Taking a look at the daily here we had a previous demand level at 400.6 that we came up and attempted to close over today and hard rejected. Generally speaking when we have a demand level like that and we get a massive rejection it is very bearish for the future. Not only that but we kissed the daily 8ema resistance today and hard rejected it with the wick and we hard rejected the daily 200/50ema with the candle body. 

The most bullish thing that we can take away from today is that we bounced off the daily 100ema support once again. However, with the demand level rejection, and daily 8/50/200ema rejection I am going to be looking for a bigger sell off here on SPY this week. My target remains 390.1, however, we do have a previous demand level at 388.66 that we could bounce off. IF we get here and can bounce I will absolutely be looking for a play back to 405.8 demand. 

Current demand levels= 388.66 and 405.81. 

Key SPY Support- 397.7 -> 396.4 -> 395.4 -> 393.6 -> 391.5

Key SPY Resistance- 400 -> 401.7 -> 403.2

The futures candle with this hanging man candle with a beautiful daily 8, 50 and 200ema rejection screams downside to me. However, there IS a double bottom here off 3975. Bears need to break through that level tomorrow and more importantly close under that level. 

I am targeting 3920 support bounce on futures. If we are able to get there then I will 100% be looking for a bounce back to the 4000s. 

Key Futures Support- 3975 -> 3965 -> 3945 -> 3920

Key Futures Resistance- 4000 -> 4020 -> 4032 -> 4055

So Tesla investor day is on Wednesday apparently at 4pm‚Ä¶ I thought about it over the weekend and thought some lotto calls for investor day to let ride would be a great play and well that turns out to be absolutely correct. However that ship has far sailed‚Ä¶ a day too late for sure‚Ä¶ 

Taking a look at tesla here we had that really nice hammer candle doji that also re-established 196.3 as demand on Friday. That led to a pretty massive bounce and yet another gap to the upside. We also have no held the daily 8ema as support and have closed over the 202.1 resistance it fought at all week. 

Our next demand level is 211.5 and that is where I will be keeping an eye on for this week and tomorrow. There is a very real buy the rumor sell the news potential with Tesla this week. 

Demand levels- 196.3 and 211.5

Key Tesla Support- 205.1 -> 202.1 -> 197.8 -> 196.3

Key Tesla Resistance- 207.9 -> 211.6 -> 214.2

The VIX was pretty much all over the place today. Despite the VIX pretty much dropping from opening this morning it did have a bounce off the daily 8ema which at the same time provided a downside opportunity for SPY. The one interesting take here is that SPY did NOT recover despite the VIX continuing its sell off. Watching the VIX continue to unwind while SPY falls is something very important to take note of.

Started the week off really nicely today. I am pretty happy with the day overall and I am even okay with the two losses I took. The first loss was on a potential breakout that ended up with a massive 50cent plus blip down that of course no one could have expected. The second loss I ended up cutting my put early when we broke through a key resistance. It would have ended up coming back to be extremely profitable, however, while I didn‚Äôt watch it the whole time I believe my -10% stop would have hit first. 

I did move up to a -10% stop this week officially and went live with that. So far so good obviously. It is definitely nicer knowing 2 nice wins breaks me even instead of 3 nice wins. However, will continue to evaluate as time goes on. So far so good and positive results there.",DaddyDersch,69,1677533186.0

11dm1km,Trafigura‚Äôs Non-Existent Nickel Was Bought by a US Firm,"By
Jonathan Browning and Jack Farchy

February 27, 2023 at 12:27 PM EST

*Buyers named as Xiamen C&D, Mind ID, Argentem and Axiom

*Filings show some of the buyers have uncovered problems

Trafigura Group¬†sold cargoes of nickel it now believes may not have contained any of the metal to buyers including a US trade finance firm and a state-owned Indonesian mining company, according to court documents.

The question of how far through the market containers of non-existent nickel had spread has been one of the top concerns for traders ever since Trafigura revealed earlier this month that it had been the victim of what it described as a ‚Äúsystematic fraud.‚Äù

The trading house said it stood to lose $577 million after paying companies linked to Indian businessman Prateek Gupta for cargoes of nickel, only to discover that they actually held much lower value goods.

While most of the dozens of cargoes involved are owned by Trafigura, Bloomberg previously reported that the trader sold several cargoes on to third parties for $93.9 million.

According to court filings, the buyers of those cargoes were: two trading units of Xiamen C&D, a Chinese state-owned conglomerate; Mind ID Trading Pte, the trading unit of Indonesia‚Äôs state mining company; Argentem Trade Services LLC, a trade finance company affiliated with hedge fund Argentem Creek Partners; and Axiom Ltd., a Hong Kong trading company.


While Trafigura has only inspected a relatively small proportion of the more than 1,000 containers it bought from companies linked to Gupta, it has not found any of them to contain nickel.

The court filings show that some of the buyers of the cargoes have also uncovered problems with them. According to the affidavit of Socrates Economou, Trafigura‚Äôs former head of nickel trading:

Xiamen noticed inconsistencies in the paperwork for its cargoes, and in December Trafigura agreed to buy some of some of them back. In February, Xiamen wrote to Trafigura, suggesting that ‚Äúthe goods are completely wrong,‚Äù and ‚Äúit is a fraud not a simply quality problem.‚ÄùAxiom wrote to Trafigura in January after inspecting its cargo, saying that there were ‚Äúlarge discrepancies/deviations between our mutually agreed contract terms and the material actually supplied.‚ÄùMind ID opened several of the containers it had bought from Trafigura in early January and discovered that they did not contain the material specified in the contract.Argentem has been trying to arrange an inspection of its material, which has not yet reached its discharge port.

In several instances, Gupta became personally involved in trying to resolve the issues with the buyers of the cargoes, according to the court filings. He told Economou by Whatsapp message that he was negotiating a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù with Axiom, and that he had ‚Äúverbally offered‚Äù a solution to Mind ID involving a letter of credit to secure his obligation toward them.

Trafigura said in court filings previously reported by Bloomberg that it may be liable for the $93.9 million that was paid to it by these third parties.

The four buyers did not immediately respond to emails and phone calls seeking comment. A spokesperson for Gupta declined to immediately comment. The spokesman said last week that Gupta planned a ‚Äúrobust response‚Äù to Trafigura‚Äôs allegations.

A Trafigura spokesperson said: ‚ÄúThis was a systematic fraud perpetrated after a long and legitimate business relationship dating back to 2015 that involved misrepresentation and widespread falsification of primary and supporting documentation. A number of red flags were identified that resulted in this investigation. Any fraud is an opportunity to review and tighten systems and procedures and a thorough review is underway.‚Äù

Tomorrow‚Äôs Q4 earnings report shouldn‚Äôt be a big surprise for AMC ‚Äî both IMAX and CNK have already reported and shed some light on the 10-12% YoY drop in box office revenues from last quarter.   Yet IMAX has better technology and at least CNK is still trading at 2.5 times below its recovery pre-pandemic highs with a 20%+ short float ‚Äî so one could justify a meme-like over reaction for that little deep value play.   But AMC continues to evade rational thought and behavior as it rockets to the moon once again.  Spoiler alert ‚Äî AMC‚Äôs Q4 results will be mixed at best with plenty of positive forward guidance due to a strong movie slate over the next several months.  And nobody is better at positive spin than Mr. Aaron.  But when you‚Äôve already shot up 20-30% in the hours before the earnings report (and close to 70% YTD) ‚Äî where else is there to go but down?

# What Didn't Work

**Natural Gas, China, Metals and Bonds**. Natural gas futures fell -34% over the February expiration. UNG puts were what bears in this should have been holding. This is promising news for the disinflation narrative that Fed has been mentioning. $DXY got a floor underneath it in February as the idea of 5% rates begins to set in. We will be following up with dollar in the next expiration month to view progress on the rates story. It makes sense that a stronger dollar would have this effect on the market. Bonds lower as the pricing in of higher rates. Metals, often correlated with faith in fiat currencies, are seen lower after a massive run starting in November.

# Conclusion

If you were looking for trades after the January expiration rollover, the following ones would be most ideal for a trade into February expiration.

**Bullish Trades**

* ARKK calls
   * The IV was significantly lower at the start of the expiration than the end while simultaneously increasing in IV makes call buying the right play heading into expiration. The ideal time to exit positions were on February 2nd.

**Bearish Trades**

* UNG puts
   * Natural gas has been in a bear market going back to its peak in August. The February expiration saw some of the worst of the decline falling a whopping 34%
* GDX puts
   * GDX gave an even more ideal entry date for a short a couple days into expiration for even more alpha.",Fox_Technicals,4,1677528477.0

But wait, there's more! This week is all about retail earnings, with big names like Target, Lowes, Macy's, Best Buy, Costco, Kroger, and Salesforce all reporting. We'll get a glimpse into consumer spending and how it's holding up against inflation and rising interest rates. And speaking of interest rates, the Fed has some members speaking throughout the week, which could impact our investments.

Plus, we've got an extra week until the employment report comes out, which means investors and the jobs number aren't ""talking"" to each other. This could introduce some added weight to any comments made by Fed members. Currently, the Fed is expected to raise rates a quarter point, but there's a chance they might go for a half point rate hike, which is over 26% at the moment.

And if that wasn't enough excitement for you, volatility is increasing. Last week, the VIX hit just above 23, leading to an increase in hedges against further volatility. The daily average volume of call options trading on the VIX is at its highest level since March 2020. 

We've already seen a weaker than expected durable goods report this morning, but pending home sales are coming up later this morning. Keep an eye on the S&P 500 and its 200-day moving average, because a break below that could mean trouble.

in other words, it doesn't matter how fast a stock is growing revenues if they do not have enough cash to stay solvent and the quarterly losses are such that there is no logical path to profitability and as such staying SOLVENT.

Good morning! Today, stock futures increased as major indexes attempted to recover from the significant weekly losses of the previous Friday. The focus continues to be on inflation, the Federal Reserve, and consumer spending. This week, investors can expect to receive updates on durable goods orders, consumer confidence, ISM manufacturing surveys, and important retail earnings. Despite three consecutive weeks of losses, there remains a short-term market risk to the downside, with a minority opinion that the Fed may increase rates by 50bps instead of 25bps in March. Louis Navellier, chairman and founder of Navellier & Associates, said that the bears are recovering after a tough January. Warren Buffett's annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders is eagerly anticipated each year for his investing strategy and business perspective. In the letter, he discusses the benefits of stock buybacks for all shareholders, despite some criticism. Meanwhile, Ukraine has received an unexpected aid package of $400 million from Saudi Arabia, including $100 million for joint humanitarian efforts.

11dbgx5,‚ÄòThe market has gone too far:‚Äô Chief global strategist predicts when the Fed will cut rates,"Investors should not expect a cut in interest rates until 2024 thanks to a strong U.S. economy and the potential for a delayed recession, according to the chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors.

Seema Shah told CNBC Friday that a tight labor market, fueling inflation, means that the previously predicted third-quarter recession for the U.S. economy will likely be delayed until later in the year.

In fact, the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates higher for longer is the ‚Äúscenario that we‚Äôre looking at now,‚Äù Shah told CNBC‚Äôs Julianna Tatelbaum. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking at tighter policy, which does unfortunately mean that for the market, it is a little bit more concerning.‚Äù

The employment picture started 2023 on a stunningly strong note, with nonfarm payrolls posting their biggest gain since July 2022 despite a rapid increase in interest rates last year.

**‚ÄòAbsolutely no cuts this year‚Äô**

When asked when investors should expect a cut in interest rates, Shah responded that it wouldn‚Äôt be until 2024.

It comes as economists appear torn on when the Fed will start to reduce rates, and by how much. Goldman Sachs expects interest rates to hit 5.38% by the second quarter, with the first cut to 5.13% expected in the first three months of next year.

Economists polled by Reuters, however, expect the U.S. central bank to cut rates in the fourth quarter of this year to a range of 4.75%-5.0%, after hitting a peak of 5%-5.25% in the third quarter.

The U.S. central bank currently targets a range of 4.5%-4.75% for its main interest rate.

Shah explained that tracking inflation numbers now and comparing them to the 1970s cycle showed a very close correlation; if rates were cut too early, inflation could increase.

The 1970s saw double-digit rates of inflation in the United States. As a result, the U.S. central bank was forced to raise interest rates to 20% after inflation initially dipped in the mid-70s but rose again more strongly later in the decade.

‚ÄúThe one big takeaway is that for the Federal Reserve, they clearly have a lot more work to do,‚Äù Shah, a strategist at Principal, an asset manager with more than $700 billion under management as of the end of 2021. ‚ÄúWe are expecting further rate hikes. Absolutely no cuts this year.‚Äù

**Stock market impact**

Shah implied that markets had not yet fully priced in the cost of rates staying up this year. She pointed toward a surge in bond yields over the past two weeks as an indicator of ‚Äúpressure that is building up‚Äù for a re-pricing in stock markets.

‚ÄúI think that the market has gone too far,‚Äù she said, referring to the 9% gain for the S&P 500 since September.

‚ÄúWe have seen a number of investors saying: ‚ÄòLook at the economy; it is so strong. How can we possibly be negative at this stage?‚Äô ... We‚Äôre just saying, the Fed is going to keep going, that means that pressure will continue,‚Äù she added.

The strategist echoed comments made by JPMorgan Chase¬†CEO Jamie Dimon, who said¬†Thursday that containing inflation remains a work in progress for the Federal Reserve while noting the U.S. economy continues to show signs of strength.

‚ÄúI have all the respect for \[Fed Chair Jerome\] Powell, but the fact is we lost a little bit of control of inflation,‚Äù Dimon said in an interview with CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer during the ‚ÄúHalftime Report.‚Äù

Dimon himself said he expects that interest rates could ‚Äúpossibly‚Äù remain higher for longer, as it may take the central bank ‚Äúa while‚Äù to get to its goal of 2% inflation.

In fact, it is very simple. You only need to learn about those people who have made great achievements in the US stock market, and you can learn a lot. Imitation is also a way to succeed. It can be seen from Buffett's short-term transaction of AAPL this year. Short-term investment in the current market is very reasonable. Short-term investment has high investment flexibility. The advantages such as the fact that funds are not easily covered are perfectly adapted to the current market turmoil.

But short-term investment requires a very high level of investment from investors.

These stock stats provide some key financial ratios for the company over the past few months. Here are some observations:

**‚Ä¢ Market Cap:** The market capitalization of the company has fluctuated over the past few months, but has been relatively stable between July 2022 and October 2022.

**‚Ä¢ Enterprise Value:** The enterprise value of the company has also fluctuated, but generally declined over the past few months. This indicates that the market values the company's equity more than its **debt and other liabilities.**

**‚Ä¢ Trailing P/E:** The price-to-earnings ratio based on the last 12 months of earnings has been trending downwards, which can suggest a lower valuation or lower earnings growth.

**‚Ä¢ Forward P/E:** The price-to-earnings ratio based on estimated earnings for the next 12 months is also trending downwards, which suggests a more positive outlook for future earnings.

**‚Ä¢ PEG Ratio:** The PEG ratio is high, indicating that the stock is relatively expensive compared to its expected earnings growth over the next five years.

**‚Ä¢ Price/Sales:** The price-to-sales ratio has been relatively stable over the past few months, indicating that the market has been valuing the company's revenue consistently.

**‚Ä¢ Price/Book:** The price-to-book ratio has fluctuated over the past few months, but has generally been in the range of 6-8, which suggests that the market values the company's equity at a moderate premium to its book value.

**‚Ä¢ Enterprise Value/Revenue:** The enterprise value-to-revenue ratio has been trending downwards, which suggests that the market is valuing the company's revenue at a lower multiple than before.

**‚Ä¢ Enterprise Value/EBITDA:** The enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio has fluctuated widely, indicating that the market values the company's EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) at different multiples at different times.

Overall, the trends in the stock stats suggest that the market is uncertain about the company's future prospects and is valuing its various financial metrics at different multiples at different times

# Stock Price History:

Beta (5Y Monthly) **1.04**

*52-Week Change*   **-16.42%**

*S&P500 52-Week Change*  **-9.23%**

*52 Week High*   **254.87** 

*52 Week Low*   **137.16**

*50-Day Moving Average*  **161.15** 

*200-Day Moving Average*  **160.73**

From the stock price history provided, there are a few observations that can be made, but it's difficult to draw a clear conclusion or consensus without additional context or analysis. Here are a few points to consider:

‚Ä¢ The beta of 1.04 indicates that the stock is slightly more volatile than the overall market.

‚Ä¢ The 52-week change of -16.42% suggests that the stock has declined in value over the past year.

‚Ä¢ The S&P500 52-week change of -9.23% indicates that the broader market has also experienced a decline over the past year, although to a lesser extent than the stock in question.

‚Ä¢ The 52-week high and low prices of 254.87 and 137.16, respectively, suggest that the stock has experienced a significant range of price fluctuations over the past year.

‚Ä¢ The 50-day moving average of 161.15 and the 200-day moving average of 160.73 suggest that the stock has been relatively stable in the short term, but has experienced some volatility over the longer term.

Based on these observations, it's possible to speculate that the stock has faced some challenges or headwinds over the past year, given its decline in value and the wider market trend. However, it's difficult to draw any firm conclusion or consensus without further analysis of the company's financial performance, industry trends, and other relevant factors that could influence the stock price. It's also worth noting that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results and that investing always carries risk.

*At the current trading price of* ***$166.96***, it is clear that the stock has recovered somewhat from its 52-week low of $137.16, although it is still below its 52-week high of $254.87. The current price may also impact the interpretation of the moving averages, which suggest that the stock has been relatively stable in the short and long term. Given the recent recovery in price, *it's possible to speculate that the market may be more optimistic about the stock's future prospects.*

**‚Ä¢ Payout Ratio:** The payout ratio is 51.64%, which means that the company distributes approximately half of its earnings as dividends.

**‚Ä¢ Dividend and Ex-Dividend Dates:** The next dividend is scheduled for March 10, 2023, with an ex-dividend date of February 14, 2023.

Overall, **the dividend and split data suggest that the company has a history of paying stable and consistent dividends.** The forward dividend rate and yield are slightly higher than the trailing values, **which could suggest that the company is confident in its future earnings and cash flow.**

# Balance Sheet: 

The balance sheet shows the company's assets, liabilities, and equity as of the last three years. Here are some observations:

**‚Ä¢Total Assets:** The Company‚Äôs total assets as of the latest period is $53.81 billion.

**‚Ä¢Total Liabilities:** The total liabilities and minority interest as of the latest period is $40.98 billion.

**‚Ä¢Total Equity:** The total equity and minority interest as of the latest period is $12.83 billion.

**‚Ä¢Common Stock Equity:** The common stock equity as of the latest period is $12.83 billion.

**‚Ä¢Total Capitalization:** The total capitalization as of the latest period is $26.38 billion.

**‚Ä¢Net Tangible Assets:** The net tangible assets as of the latest period is $12.17 billion.

**‚Ä¢Working Capital:** The working capital as of the latest period is -$174 million, which means that the company has a negative working capital.

**‚Ä¢Total Debt:** The total debt as of the latest period is $16.47 billion.

**‚Ä¢Net Debt:** The net debt as of the latest period is $12.79 billion.

**‚Ä¢Share Issued:** The number of shares issued as of the latest period is 471,274.

Overall, the balance sheet shows that the company has significant assets and liabilities, and its common stock equity has decreased over the past three years. T**he negative working capital is a concern and may suggest that the company is facing some liquidity issues.** The total debt and net debt levels suggest that **the company may be carrying a significant debt load, which could impact its ability to invest in future growth.**

*If we consider the current situation of rising interest rates and high inflation, it would change the interpretation of the financial figures. As interest rates increase, it becomes more expensive for companies to service their debts. Therefore, carrying a significant debt load can have a negative impact on the company's financial position, especially in times of rising interest rates.*

Additionally, **high inflation rates can negatively impact a company's earnings, as it can lead to higher costs of goods sold and other expenses. This could reduce the company's profit margins and ultimately, its overall profitability.**

Furthermore, **negative working capital can also be a concern in times of high inflation and rising interest rates, as the company may face difficulty in paying off its short-term liabilities. This could ultimately result in a liquidity crisis and financial distress.**

Overall, in the current situation of high inflation and rising interest rates, it is important for companies to carefully manage their debt levels, and ensure they have adequate liquidity to weather any short-term financial challenges.

**Analyzing the cash flow statement** in conjunction with ***the income statement and balance sheet,*** and taking into account current market dynamics, the following observations can be made:

‚Ä¢The operating cash flow has declined significantly from $10.5 billion in 2020 to $3.6 billion TTM, indicating that the company is generating less cash from its core operations. This decline in cash flow may be due to a decrease in revenue or an increase in operating expenses.

‚Ä¢The free cash flow, which is the cash available after capital expenditures, has been inconsistent over the past three years, with a significant decline in 2021. This inconsistency may be due to changes in capital expenditures or other investments made by the company.

‚Ä¢The company has negative working capital, which could be a cause for concern. Negative working capital means that the company has more short-term liabilities than current assets, which can result in liquidity issues if the company is unable to pay off its short-term obligations.

‚Ä¢The company has been investing heavily in capital expenditures, with $5.4 billion in 2021 TTM. While investment in capital expenditures can drive growth, it can also result in a reduction of cash available for other purposes, such as paying off debt or returning cash to shareholders.

‚Ä¢The company has been repurchasing its capital stock, which can reduce the number of outstanding shares and increase earnings per share. However, this can also result in a decrease in cash available for other purposes, such as investing in growth opportunities.

‚Ä¢The company has been issuing debt and repaying debt, which can impact its financial position, especially in times of rising interest rates. The company's total debt increased in 2021 TTM, and its debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high, indicating a significant amount of leverage.

Overall, **the company's cash flow statement highlights some areas of concern, particularly the decline in operating cash flow and negative working capital, which could lead to liquidity issues** if not managed effectively. Additionally, the company's heavy investment in capital expenditures and repurchasing of capital stock could impact its financial position, and its high level of debt could pose a risk in a rising interest rate environment.

&#x200B;

# Analyst Opinions: 

Based on the analyst estimates for the next 4 quarters, there is a consensus that earnings will increase over the next year, but at a slower rate than in the previous year. The average EPS estimate for the current year is $5.54, which is lower than the previous year's EPS of $13.56. However, the average EPS estimate for next year is $9.29, which indicates a significant increase in earnings. The revenue estimates also suggest modest growth for the next 2 years, with a 2.3% increase in 2023 and a 2.5% increase in 2024.

The earnings history and trend suggest that there has been some variability in actual earnings compared to estimates, with a few quarters having surprises both positively and negatively. The current EPS estimate has remained relatively stable over the last 90 days, but there have been some revisions to both the current and next year's estimates in the last 30 days.

Overall, these estimates suggest that there is a moderate expectation for growth in the company's earnings and revenue over the next two years, but there is some uncertainty and variability in actual earnings compared to estimates.

***If the market is worried about inflation and a potential recession, it could have an impact on the company's financial performance and stock price. Inflation could lead to higher costs for the company, which could impact its profitability and margins.*** A potential recession could also impact consumer spending and demand for the company's products or services. This could result in lower revenue and earnings for the company, which could negatively impact its stock price.

Therefore, if the market is worried about these macroeconomic factors, it could lead to a more cautious outlook for the company and its stock.

# Summary (TLDR): 

Based on the information provided, TGT stock for Target Corporation appears to have a stable financial performance in terms of revenue growth, profitability, and management effectiveness. However, **there are concerns about the company's ability to manage its debt, particularly in a high-inflation environment with rising interest rates.** The cash flow analysis indicates that the company has been generating positive operating cash flow but has also been carrying out significant capital expenditures and repurchasing capital stock.

Looking at the analyst estimates, there seems to be a general expectation of moderate growth in earnings and revenue for the next few quarters and years. However, the estimates have shown some downward revisions, possibly due to concerns about inflation and a potential recession.

Overall, TGT stock seems to be a stable investment choice, but investors should be aware of the potential risks associated with high debt levels and the current economic climate. As with any investment, it's essential to conduct thorough research and analysis before making any decisions.

Both of these have fallen about 5-6% since those peaks, with last weak spy being down 2.3% and nasdaq being 3.1% down. Most of these drops have been triggered by bad inflation reports, but without bad inflation coming out what will crash the market? Last Friday PCE came in HOT HOT, having grown 0.6%, and being 5.4% year over year, normally the market would have crashed 2%+ from this, but we only closed 1 percent down showing that the market is unwilling to crash. Further more the growth that we have had this year was mostly retail investors, and they are not showing any signs of stopping. We have crossed the support that held down the October bottom and the December lows, but that was pre market and we actually almost recovered and went above it again on Friday.

&#x200B;

Personally I think that the March low won't be going below 390-385, and it will quickly bounce up to that support that we broke on Friday. I think that next week is gonna be green with a potential bounce to 405 to 410, and then we will stay mostly flat until CPI. When CPI comes out we will plummet to those 390-385 levels but when FOMC happens they will do 25 bps hike which will send the market to the moon (420+ levels). Even if we stay flat next week (Which could very well happen) I will believe that we will bounce to 405-410 before CPI. 

Will see another October type low? Probably but it will probably be in L  ate Summer/Fall, while in the spring we will see smaller type bounces like we are seeing right now and like we saw in December.

So why would huge companies pour literal tons of their own monetary resources into their stocks instead of significantly hoarding it or at least greatly diversifying? Is it probably a bluff to lull investors into a false sense of ease? Or is it just a roll of their own dice in the short term, with not much concern over the long?

Wall Street's response to the higher-than-anticipated inflation data showed that the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening campaign has a long road ahead, diminishing the likelihood of a gentle landing.

Volatility has risen after a prolonged period of calm stock movements. Beyond economic uncertainties, this is due to an expensive market resulting from a buoyant rally since October. These gains are decreasing day by day, as concerns of an impending recession have clouded the outlook for American companies.

The S&P 500 declined even further on Friday, deepening its worst weekly downturn in 2023. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 plummeted almost 2% as the two-year treasury yield hit its highest since 2007 at 4.8%, while the dollar rose. Swaps are currently pricing in 25 basis point hikes at the Fed's next three meetings, and wagers on the peak rate have climbed to approximately 5.4% by July. The benchmark lies between 4.5% and 4.75%.

The unexpected surge in the personal consumption expenditures gauge revealed the dangers of continuously high inflation. Moreover, resilient spending combined with the exceptional strength of the labor market may make it more challenging for the Fed to meet its 2% inflation objective. In contrast, separate data showed that consumer sentiment climbed to its highest level in a year, while new home sales exceeded forecasts.

# SPY trading between 200 and 50-day moving averages

The SPY is currently trading between its 200 and 50-day moving averages on a daily basis. We noticed some buying activity near the 393 level that we discussed last week. As we approach the prior resistance diagonal backtest and the uptrend support line, there could be a potential pivot zone around 393, 390, and 387. I'm anticipating a possible struggle and increased choppiness in the market this week.

Assuming we do experience a rebound at this level, I'll be keeping an eye on the sell side discount in the vicinity of the 404-406 area.

## Expected Move Based on Patterns

#### What is a rising wedge pattern?

The rising wedge is a common technical chart pattern utilized to detect potential trend reversals in financial markets. This pattern emerges as an upward-sloping price chart with two converging trendlines. Decreasing trading volume frequently accompanies this formation. Wedges can appear in either a rising or falling direction. A rising wedge is generally viewed as a bearish chart pattern that suggests a potential downward breakout.

Most, if not all, stock market analysts attempt to predict what a stock or the stock market will do in the future.  They use fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and experience to predict the direction and potential levels to be reached before a potential turning point.  We, on the other hand, analyze what a stock, bond, ETF, or index is unlikely to do in the future based upon its own historical data.  Unlike RSI, Bollinger Bands, or other technical indicators that provide similar information, our measure uses the entire stock/ETF/index trading history to determine what the stock/ETF/index is unlikely to do.  

So what is it ??

We have developed a machine learning system that measures a symbols' percentage price change versus time for multiple time periods and compares the symbols recent price behavior to its own past to determine if the current behavior is anomalous.  Think of this as a measure of momentum run amok for the symbol.  Our experience has shown that there are two levels of anomalous stock/ETF/index behavior that are of interest: (1) When the stock/ETF/index current performance is outside of 99% of all prior instances (this is called a Level 1 overbought or oversold condition) and, (2) When the stock/ETF/index current performance is outside the bounds of all of its prior history (this is called a Level 2 overbought or oversold condition).

We currently screen 600 stock/ETF/index symbols every day - with more being added each week.  These symbols are all traded US stock market exchanges during normal US trading hours.  Figure 1, below, shows a subset of symbols screened for February 24, 2023

In the first column of Figure 1, we have sets of 3 rows that have Level 1, Level 2, and Data Since labels. The Data Since rows describe the start date for each symbol associated with the date. For instance, SPX has 1/2/1962 which means that the machine learning system contains SPX data since January 2, 1962 for the computations of SPX (S&P 500). Likewise, the symbol INDY has data since November 23, 2009 for its computations, etc. Next are the rows for Level 1 and Level 2. Let's look at Level 1 first. In the rows for Level 1, a number greater than or equal to 1 indicates that on a price change % versus time basis, the symbol is overbought because it moved farther to the upside and faster than 99% of all other equivalent time periods in its history. These cells are highlighted light blue in the screener data. In the rows for Level 1, a number less or equal to zero indicates that on a price change % versus time basis, the symbol is oversold because it moved farther to the downside and faster than 99% of all other equivalent time periods in its history. These cells are highlighted light red in the screener data file. Level 2 is similar to Level 1 except that instead of 99% of the history, it is 100% of the history implying the stock/ETF/index has never moved that far that fast for any equivalent period of time in the data set. Yellow highlighted cells simply highlight symbols that are near overbought or oversold on a Level 1 or Level 2 basis.

In Figure 1, we can see that, AGG and UNG screened as Level 1 oversold AND SHOP and BAX as almost Level 1 oversold.  However, in this article, we are focusing on TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ) as it is neither overbought or oversold.

Figure 2, below, shows a chart of the TLT price action over the last six months.

So how can we use this overbought/oversold information ??

The machine learning system that determines the overbought/oversold condition also provides threshold levels that correspond to what the symbol is unlikely to do in the FUTURE based upon where it is trading now.  Table 1, below, shows various levels and limits with different probabilities of occurrence for TLT for a subset of future dates.

&#x200B;

[Table 1.  TLT Upper and Lower Closing Limits through March 23rd, 2023](https://preview.redd.it/883hnyn2yika1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=73b31a68c4e8b5c5b64117e7609f5c43c17cce85)

In Table 1, above, we show five (5) columns corresponding to ""No loss since data start"", ""Once Every 10 Years"",  ""Once Every 5 Years"", ‚ÄúOnce Every 1 Years‚Äù, and ""1% Raw Data"".  Under each column header are sub-headers titled ""Lower Limit"" and ""Upper Limit"".  Under each of these sub-headers are prices that reflect what TLT is unlikely to close below or above for varying probabilities defined the column header.  For instance, in the row corresponding to the 2/28/2023 date, we see a lower limit of 89.16 and upper limit of 116.56 under the No loss since inception column header.  This implies that TLT closing below $89.16 or above $116.56 on Tuesday, February 28, 2023 would be historical (something that's never happened before) on a percentage price change versus time basis.  Likewise, for the 03/23/2023 date, we see a lower limit of $90.22 and upper limit of $122.44 under the Once Every 5 Years header.  This implies that closing below $90.22 or above $122.44 on Friday, March 23rd, 2023 would be expected to happen once every 5 years.  Given that there are approximately 252 trading days every year, once every 5 years  corresponds to a likelihood of 1 in 1260 or 0.079%.  Finally, in the 1% Raw Data column, the prices reflect a 1% probability of closing below the indicated future lower limit prices or above the indicated future upper limit prices on the corresponding date based upon the entire history of TLT - including what it's done recently.

So who could benefit from this data ??

‚Ä¢   Options Traders.  The primary beneficiaries of this type of information are options  traders.  By providing closing price levels for a symbol for a given future date, an option trader can write option positions with a known probability of success for both Put and Call options.

‚Ä¢   Long/short strategies.  Knowing when a stock/ETF/index has moved too far, too fast is an important input in a buying/selling/shorting decision.  This screening decision is done automatically by the machine learning  computers on a daily basis.  The only thing the computer doesn't do is push the buy or sell button for you.

‚Ä¢   Elliott Wave Practitioners.  Elliott Wave analysis can be a powerful tool for analyzing the likely path a stock/ETF/index may take higher or lower.  However, there are times when multiple paths may present themselves with near equal probability using Elliott Wave analysis alone.  However, many times, one or more possible paths would require the stock/ETF/index to move in a manner that would be unlikely to happen based upon the machine learning analysis.

‚Ä¢   Fundamentalists.  All traders have two decisions to make:  When to buy and when to sell or vice versa.  A fundamental trader chooses to screen companies based upon fundamental analysis and makes buying decisions based upon this decision.  However, when does the fundamental trader choose to sell, buy more, etc.  The stock screening method explained in this paper can be a useful tool in helping make those decisions with exact price levels.",manishmehta71,4,1677413677.0
11c7rfu,What are your opinions on whether the US will have a recession or not?,"I did some research related to financial data and also some employment data, here are the key points which made me think that the US might be heading to a recession:

1) GDP growth was a 3.2% in Q4 2022 led by exports ( government's data) but on the other hand the dollar appreciated by more than 7% in Q4 so the increasing currency rate made it delusional that the exports grew, what actually happened was that exports didn't grow instead the currency grew which made the value of exports rise, and because the imports got relatively cheaper the value diminished. 
 
2) The Inventory to sales ratio reached 1.37 by December which is a clear sign that sales are not upto the mark. 
 
3) The lay-offs were high still the unemployment rate didn't increase because of the high employment rate in mining and government services, otherwise if we look at the construction sector the rate is 6.9%, and according to economic models a recession starts when the construction sector's profits decrease as people are not investing and expansion is not feasible in near future.

Ps: I myself believe that there will be a deep recession if interest rates keep increasing.

Edit: I also wanted to add that US should introduce a subject of manipulation instead of economics because that's what leads to success, economics is realy for us geeks.",OwnInformation229,189,1677394525.0

Consumer debt is at $4.8 Trillion up $400M from a year ago and up $800M prior to covid in 2019

Guess how much of that is student loans? $1.8 Trillion or almost 40%. 

Is this the catalyst that will break the camels back and cause the recession? Probably not. If you exclude the student loan debt from the picture. Consumer debt is around normal levels if not lower.

* SPY closed down 1.07%
* QQQ closed down 1.67%
* Dow Jones Industrial closed down 1.02%
* VIX closed up 2.51%

Good evening everyone, I hope you all are having a good start to your weekend. This past week we saw alot of back and forth action throughout the markets, largely spurred by data releases as well as earnings reports. Next week is a bit quieter in terms of earnings and data releases, so hopefully that will give the markets some time settle.

https://preview.redd.it/jp5dysmyoeka1.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fc0f2b331143de4dafd73159e0bdd53a8f1e1bca

SPY dropped early in the week but then seemed to find support on the 50 day EMA (green line) and the upward sloping trendline. I, like many others, thought that we would have a nice bounce from that support zone. Thursdays price action seemed to support that notation but on Friday we gapped down and opened below the trend line and the 50 day EMA. This just goes to show that the market as a whole is still not completely healthy. If you bought Thursdays rally you had to be very cautious in managing your position on Friday. From here SPY needs to hold above the 200 day EMA (white line). A break below that level would indicate a continuation of this downward price movement. It would be positive if price stays above the 200 day and then breaks with volume back above the trendline. Until there is a move in either direction there will likely be choppy price action.

https://preview.redd.it/kouxig6zoeka1.png?width=2250&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=70ac48dd2dbd2c0e82974a52d784bcd15971091d

QQQ tells a similar story, although with slightly more negative sentiment. I say this because price closed relatively unchanged from where it opened. This combine with the increased volume signal that buyers and sellers are equally matched. It may only take a small sway in investor sentiment to move this market either way. However, even with the major indices trading downwards/sideways, it is still important to look at individual sectors/industries to see where new opportunities may lie.

https://preview.redd.it/a71dyepzoeka1.png?width=2241&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=676b72d48456cd94d77d288480f86a964a3c154e

First up is HACK, a cybersecurity ETF. HACK was on the list [last week](https://everydaytrades.com/etf-and-market-evaluation-for-week-of-02-21-2023/) and has traded sideways since. Currently sitting on the 200 day EMA, HACK could be an interesting buy if price moves above $48.40 with volume. It would be a positive if the overall market moved higher as well **BUT** is not necessary if there is strong volume here. Additionally, we can also look into the top 10 holdings of HACK to see if any stocks are setting up.

https://preview.redd.it/2phgu0a0peka1.png?width=2237&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=69c717cde2edc0e4daa3fa50b1dea7625e569ae5

Now this is an example of what we do not want to see. IBB is a biotech ETF that was popular several weeks ago. However, now we can see that there is not power or leadership in this ETF. Most of the moving averages have begun to roll over and there are more red days than green indicating institutional rotation out of this sector. I thought this would be helpful to include so that we also know what not to look for.

https://preview.redd.it/j9qvq601peka1.png?width=2251&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=06e45f47d6ed80fb3583e999eaab52e64c6043b5

ITB is a home construction ETF and is currently sitting on the 50 day EMA. This is more of a pull back setup and is inherently more risky. If we see a push above $68.00 with volume that could be a buy point. It is important to stress that risk must be managed on these riskier setups.

https://preview.redd.it/gxkg2fj1peka1.png?width=2259&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fa7d76cedbd8eb922a52dd0c5d973f398137e235

PAVE is a U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF and is just below its 8 and 21 day EMA (red and orange lines). This could be interpreted as a pullback as well but the safer entry would be taking out the downward sloping trendline. Interestingly, we are also seeing large volume on up days which could be large institutional buying. Again, you can always look at the top 10 holdings to see if any individual stocks have cleaner setups.

https://preview.redd.it/2otttr02peka1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7bac2444615abf93524e2248eb5946d029bb2a77

SMH, a semiconductor ETF, also has a downward sloping trendline and price sitting near the 8 and 21 day EMA. This could be interesting if the major indices have a large move in a positive direction. Alot of the semiconductor names can move big quickly, they also can lose big quickly so risk needs to be managed.

https://preview.redd.it/hwdrg9h2peka1.png?width=2234&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cf39808f67a2f4a220073b502e146e2c02eca603

Lastly we have XAR, an aerospace and defense ETF. Given the market action the past few days XAR has held its ground well. There is not a clean entry on this chart so it would be best to look at the individual names within this ETF.

I hope this list of ETFs is able to give you some direction in refining your search for individual names. This is a great way to get ready for each week as it really lets you see who the leaders and laggards are. The next step to take is to look at the top 10 holdings of each ETF and see which stocks are setting up. Even if a stock has a great setup, in markets like this it is extremely important to have a solid risk management plan in place.",everyday_trades,19,1677362071.0

Yes, real asset prices such as homes increase in price during periods of inflation.  On a related note, when inflation stops, real asset prices do not fall back down to their original cost (things stay expensive absent deflation).

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 60% and 78%. (Stats as of 2023-01-31)",hardyrekshin,18,1677297739.0

WE are seeing some extremely aggressive pre market swings the last week or so.

The biggest story of the week really is the fact that markets has now given FOMC a 30% chance of a 50bps rate hike in march‚Ä¶ Now do I actually believe that will happen? No not really‚Ä¶ however, I do believe that with the way PCE data and everything else is coming in this week that we are going to see an upside miss on CPI. The most probable scenario I am seeing here is that we are flat to red around 380-390 leading into CPI‚Ä¶ CPI misses to upside and we touch 360-370s. However FOMC will come in with a 25bps rate hike and that will lead to a market wide rally back to 390. 

The algos this week were definitely on another level‚Ä¶

The bulls attempted to break SPY back over the daily 100ema today and even made a convincing run for it there at the EOD. However, we did reject and we are now closing below the daily 100ema for the first time since January 19th. 

There is an extreme red bear channel with support at 388.2 and resistance at 396.7 for Monday. However, the bigger broader bear channel gives support at 392.5 on Monday. 

Even though this sell off has felt like a lot more‚Ä¶ we have actually only dropped about 5% over 7 days total‚Ä¶ and besides Tuesday really none of it has been continuous. This has been one of the most choppy dumps I have seen on spy in a while.

I personally think that the SPY weekly chart is the big story and is telling of what to come here this next week and March. We had a support line dating back to the October bottom and January consolidation area that we lost support on this week. Breaking this pretty massive rising wedge absolutely opens downside. 

Something I mentioned a long time ago was that with the JPM collar historically we see a trend for the first 7 weeks post roll and that is the peak or trough and then we see a retrace of that said trend until week 11. Currently SPY is playing that out perfectly which means we have 2 more weeks of consolidation/ dropping. 

We also just closed SPY below the weekly 8 and 20ema support for the first time since December. When you look back at SPY anytime we close below the 8ema and especially the 20ema it usually leads to a good sized retrace. 

My main target remains 390 support on SPY. However, if we were to break through that I would start looking at 383 support next. 

Key Weekly SPY Support- 396.3 -> 390.2 -> 393.2

Key Weekly SPY Resistance- 398.8 -> 402.6 -> 407.2

I actually believe that futures daily shows a far more bearish story here than SPY daily does. IF you look at the futures daily here we have what I have coined the classic ‚Äú123 rollercoaster.‚Äù What that means is we have an initial break down (1) (this would be the move from 4160 to 3985) and then we have the relieve bounce (2) (this is the move from 3985 to 4035) and then we get the continuation of the initial move (3) (this would be touching 3920 area. 

This week we saw that massive Tuesday bounce, and really we consolidated, attempted to retake the daily 200 and 50ema, however we rejected and actually now will be closing below the daily 100ema. With Futures (and SPY) closing below the daily 8, 20, 50, 100, and 200ema for the first time since January 5th we should absolutely look for further downside. We have a classic bearish 8/20ema crossover and we lost, retested and rejected the daily 200ema which should also be seen as very bearish. 

&#x200B;

Similar idea here on the futures weekly chart. We are seeing a classic breakdown with a close below the 8, 20, 50 and 100ema supports. With that rejection and losing the key upside resistance at 4095 (407.3 on spy) we should be looing for a retest of mean which is that 3920 area on futures (390.1 on spy). 

Key Weekly Futures Support- 3975 -> 3920 -> 3860

Key Weekly Futures Resistance- 4020 -> 4080 ->  4095

Honestly tesla daily here is a tough one and a frustrating one. We are finally seeing weakness and we actually closed below that key support of 197.1 which should be a big deal specially closing our first full candle below the daily 8ema‚Ä¶ with overall market weakness and assumingly risk coming off in the market Tesla should be one of the biggest to fall‚Ä¶ However, it is still showing quite impressive daily strength. Last bulls support is going to be that 192 support. There is still a chance that tesla is just ranging from 192 to 215 and realistically I don‚Äôt like any plays here till one of those hard breaks.

Weekly wise here actually very similar to Meta we are seeing more of a bull flag/ bullish support bounce set up then I am on SPY and other tickers like Apple, MSFT, and Amzn. Now the biggest thing here is that this is an inside weekly candle on Tesla which generally speaking does lead to further upside. However, this is clearly at a decision point too. With Tesla still holding its 8, 20 and 200ema support here I have a hard time wanting to be long on puts on it just yet. IF tesla loses 189.8 and realistically 178 then the downside move is going to be large and aggressive. 

Tesla Weekly Support- 189.8 -> 178 -> 164

Tesla Weekly Resistance- 208.4 -> 226.6

The VIX gives us a whole lot of noting here too. On one hand this is clearly a inverted hammer/ hanging man candle and generally speaking could be seen as a downside candle for VIX or upside move for SPY. However, take a look at Friday on the VIX‚Ä¶ obviously different setup but similar idea of downside on the VIX however, it immediately bounced. 

The issue is that there is SO much 0dte activity the VIX isnt staying elevated or moving like it used to. Yes at times it perfectly tracks and I believe we can enter/ exit with its supporting our move. However, people are piled in 30+ dte puts like we used to see‚Ä¶ people are piling into 0-7dte puts here and then immediately exiting sometimes the same day when they are right. That‚Äôs exactly what happened on Thursday‚Ä¶ if you didn‚Äôt see the article there was a whale who bought 26k of 0dte 4000puts on ES futures that caused that massive $6 meltdown‚Ä¶ once he sold (took profits) on those we have a massive $6 rally. 

We are seeing it a lot lately with these irrational breakouts, 50 cent instant moves on SPY and just overall nonsense. 0dte is nice but honestly it is kinda ruining the market at times.

Honestly just a frustrating day trading and frustrating week trading. I started the week off pretty deep in the hole thanks to those 0dte ES calls I swang that got absolutely rocked. From there the biggest issue here was that the moves were so damn aggressive and so dang fast that by time I liked what I saw and clicked confirm/ send the premiums had already jumped 20-30 cents at a time. It was a snooze you loose trading all week long. 

And then of course the ones I did get in on absolutely got theta ate and I either ended up in the red and stop lossed or by time the move was done it got theta ate so much it never saw profits. 

One change that I have been considering for a long time is going to a -10% stop loss instead of -15%... I actually moved from a -20% to -15% sometimes end of 2022 and that was a big positive change for me. However, with these 0dte every day the pay out on premiums and moves is so small we aren‚Äôt seeing the same profits we used to. Not only that a day like today with extremely high IV only moved a total of $3.61 all day (intraday) that leaves absolutely no room for reward either. 

Its kinda crazy as I was talking to my friend about ‚Äúwhat changed‚Äù when I went from 10-15% average wins to 3-5% wins.. and my answer was nothing‚Ä¶ I looked back and the very week that SPY 0dte every day hit the markets my average win and average profits all took a huge loss. Win rate never really changed but I went from averaging 10-15% on most wins (using 3-4dte) to barely getting 5% most trades before it either reverses, iv crushes or theta eats me. 

This market is ever changing and ever frustrating. But in the end it‚Äôs a marathon not a sprint. And as I said all of 2022‚Ä¶ everyone should be looking at capital preservation so that in 2024 or 2025 when a bull market comes back you have the funds to finally get the reward that most are missing out on.",DaddyDersch,115,1677274644.0

11b1wlt,ECPG - Encore Capital,"Hi guys. My first time posting some DD so please be gentle and maybe take me to dinner before you bend me over and tell me where I‚Äôm wrong.

The news today that inflation still isn‚Äôt under control an the fed is looking hawkish plus consumer debt exploding make a fairly obnoxious cocktail. My hypothesis is that the winner soon may be debt collectors and those who offer similar services. As the consumer debt market gets flooded with more credit card debt etc. the debt collectors will be able to bid at lower price and margins will be wider than your wife‚Äôs snatch.

ECPG collects debt in the US and Europe though its subsidiaries, Midland Credit Management and Cabot Credit Management respectively.

The stocks can currently be slide across the table for $53.53. The P/E ratio is 10.23 which makes it seem under valued with a market cap of $1.25b especially when considering the assets on the balance sheet total $4.51b Vs a manageable $3.33b in liabilities.

The bear case is that the p&l looks choppy with $194m in profit for 2022 compared to a ¬£351m profit in 2021. This is on top of net ¬£73m loss in Q4 2022. Earnings report is in May so we‚Äôll know a lot me then.

It‚Äôs a move that essentially shorts the market and I‚Äôm feel pretty bearish at the moment.",Dank-but-true,0,1677272334.0

11axgz7,SPY Greek Chain Visuals 2024 vs 2027," 

Based on Vol skew graphics above - VIX usually skews to put side heavily and quickly signaling fear and a market sell off. On the other side, SPY vol skew usually has a drastic move to call skew with ATM options which tends to signal a bull run.

I am not seeing either of those things happen at the moment. These are not 100% in calling the moves, but based on volatily skew & greek viz of the entire chain - I don't see the big move happening yet. I am staying in cash or selling downside premium.

What do you see that I am missing?

Delta:

* Delta represents the rate of change of an option's price with respect to a change in the underlying's price.
* A positive delta indicates a bullish strategy, while a negative delta indicates a bearish strategy.
* Delta can also be used to add, subtract, or neutralize deltas from being long or short stock.
* Delta can be used as a proxy for estimating the probability of an option being in-the-money (ITM).

Theta:

* Theta measures the daily decay of an option's extrinsic value.
* Positive theta is when an option's extrinsic value decreases over time, which is beneficial for option sellers.
* Negative theta represents an increase in an option's extrinsic value over time, which is detrimental for option buyers.
* Traders can manage theta by using various strategies such as selling options with longer expirations and higher implied volatility.

Gamma:

* Gamma measures the rate of change of an option's delta.
* For long option holders, gamma can be beneficial because it accelerates profits as the underlying asset's price moves in the holder's favor.
* For short option sellers, gamma can be risky because it can accelerate losses and decelerate gains.
* Gamma plays a role in expiration risk.

Vega (not shown except through vol skew):

* Vega represents the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in volatility.
* Positive Vega is when an option's price increases as volatility increases.
* Negative Vega is when an option's price decreases as volatility decreases.",elpresidentedeltoro,22,1677261225.0
