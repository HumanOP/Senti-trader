Paid for the entire wedding using the money gambled in the market which she did not contribute anything to. She refuses to acknowledge my in depth analysis/ Reddit research and says I‚Äôm just gambling out (actually mine) life savings everyday. Meanwhile she contributes nothing monetarily to the relationship and just spends everyday having Tea brunch and wine nights with her gals.

We recently went on our Honeymoon and she took away my phone so I couldn‚Äôt check the markets. She ended up finding my burner phone while I was in the shower after market close.

Long story short I took a loan against the house for a  Call option last Friday and because of JPow speech yesterday they have been margin called. The house is at risk if market doesn‚Äôt bounce back and she is a little upset. Says that if we lose the house that she will file for a divorce. Everything we own is because of my gambling.

I keep telling her just because the market is bearish doesn‚Äôt mean our relationship has to be. She doesn‚Äôt seem to understand volatility. I‚Äôm just stressed about my Call Options and she is not helping.",Honoes,4632,1678277407.0

For far too long this sub has gotten away from its identity.There has been too many posts here that belong on other subs and too much content here that has nothing to do with what we are about.

For the crayon eaters amd smooth brains here, this sub has been and always will be a place to talk about SHORT TERM SPECULATION. 

This is NOT the place to talk about just buying virgin funds like a simp so you might have half a million dollars to your name by the time you're 70 and shitting in diapers again.

This is NOT the place to talk about the demise of America and how your long term portfolio strategy is to suck jinny the poohs cock.

This is NOT the place to talk about how you're bullish on defense contractor stocks because ""war in Ukraine and maybe Taiwan sOoN"".

This is NOT the place to talk about your pathetic bags that you're holding from 2021 and 2022 because you're a cuck who got cucked by Chamath/RC/etc.

This IS the place to discuss SHORT TERM BETS on SPECULATIVE trade expressions that have asymmetrical risk profiles. 

This means your thesis is based upon SHORT TERM data and your trade relies on a CATALYST that you're betting on within 20 trading days... typically SHORTER.

This also means that your trade expression is using short dated OPTIONS contracts, FUTURES contracts, or concentrated short term holdings of SHARES.

If you're not posting about short term trading tactics based on short term data like economic data dumps, earnings reports, or some other short term catalyst, then you DO NOT belong here.

Make WALL STREET BETS great again!

wallstreetbets,11huwl3,"$ABML has $1.2 Trillion lithium ü§ØTonopah Flats property in Nevada one of largest lithium deposits in US, company says","Hello there, 

I‚Äôm gonna try keep this short and sweet for all you highly regarded folk. There‚Äôs a lithium mining/battery recycling stock going by the ticker $ABML, which just recently hit the $500 million market cap ($547 million to be precise) meaning the stock can now be spoken about on WSB. 

I may be a little special and I‚Äôm quite baked rn but I‚Äôm going to try lay out for why I think this stock is a potential 10X stock and why you don‚Äôt want to miss this opportunity. 

Firstly, the stock is currently up 78% over the last 3 months, largely as a result of its mining flats in Tonopah being assessed by a third party to contain upwards of 15 million tonnes of Lithium. That‚Äôs the largest supply of Lithium in the entirety of the USA! A country, which until now has been struggling to source and have any real security of its own affordable battery metals. I believe the Biden administration has been looking into ways to sure up America‚Äôs battery metal supply chains, as importing it is costly and relying on other countries isn‚Äôt for Uncle Sam. $ABML may have just stumbled upon the answer and if they have the stock is about to go parabolic.

You know that shit Daddy Musk and every other car company puts in his car batteries? The shit that currently costs more than gold at $70k per tonne‚Ä¶ This company has basically found itself with lithium deposits that are the same weight as 128k fat Jonah Hills. That‚Äôs pretty fucking fat.
So back of the napkin math 15 million tonnes X $70k = $1.25 trillion. That‚Äôs right $1,250,000,000! 

And the best part? $ABML controls 100% of the mining lode claims in the Tonopah flats and the subsurface minerals without any royalties. 
The company also plans to expand the area to the north and south of the property and explore to greater depths. 
90% of the 15 million tonnes is easily recoverable.
And if that‚Äôs not perfect enough, their factory is only 25 miles away from the Tesla gigafactory! 

Secondly, this is a company I‚Äôve been following for years, and it‚Äôs fair to say management hasn‚Äôt always been the best. The company is currently down 75% from it‚Äôs ATH of $4 per share, attributable to the slow progress they have made up till now. However, this company is now run by their fairly newly appointed CEO Ryan Melsert, an ex-Tesla employee who realised the importance (and financial benefits) of securing America‚Äôs battery metals supply chain. The guy is an absolute genius, the company has won countless awards and government grants for its unique, patented and environmentally-friendly way of recycling battery metals. 

The whole point of switching to electric cars is to reduce carbon emissions and damage to the environment. This company allows for what may be the most environmentally-friendly and scalable battery recycling process in the world. $ABML have a factory 25 miles from Tesla‚Äôs gigafactory and have signed agreements to recycle Ford, Chevrolet and GM‚Äôs battery feedstock. 

The company is currently pre-revenue, however I do believe that will change this year with the opening of their pilot plant. Despite the negative economic outlook we are in at the moment I can really see this stock outperforming the broader market. They‚Äôre flush with cash despite burning through it due to building their new factory. The amount of Lithium within the Tonopah flats alone is worth more than Amazon. 

Who‚Äôs to say Musk doesn‚Äôt buy the company outright? I really don‚Äôt see that as an impossibility given the company‚Äôs purpose, it‚Äôs location and the CEO‚Äôs ties to Tesla. If that happens I‚Äôd probably need to repaint my ceiling cuz my erection would be doing all sorts of damage to it. Anyway thanks for reading, I‚Äôm gonna post a few sources and go play with myself in my mom‚Äôs basement.

wallstreetbets,11l1ui8,Fed Chair Powell says interest rates are ‚Äòlikely to be higher‚Äô than previously anticipated,"* Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday cautioned that interest rates are likely to head higher than central bank policymakers had expected.
* ‚ÄúIf the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,‚Äù the central bank leader said in prepared remarks for appearances this week on Capitol Hill.
* Powell said the current trend shows that the Fed‚Äôs inflation-fighting job is not over.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday cautioned that interest rates are likely to head higher than central bank policymakers had expected.

Citing earlier data this year showing that inflation has reversed the deceleration it showed in late 2022, the central bank leader warned of tighter monetary policy ahead.

‚ÄúThe latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,‚Äù Powell said in remarks prepared for two appearances this week on Capitol Hill. ‚ÄúIf the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.‚Äù

Those remarks carry two implications: One, that the peak, or terminal, level of the federal funds rate is likely to be higher than the previous indication from the Fed officials, and, two, that the switch last month to a smaller quarter percentage point increase could be short-lived of inflation data continue to run hot.

In their December estimate, officials pegged the terminal rate at 5.1%. Current market pricing is a bit higher than that, in the 5.25%-5.5% areas, according to CME Group data. Powell did not specify how high he thinks rates ultimately will go.

The speech comes with markets generally optimistic that the Fed can tame inflation without running the economy into a ditch.

However, January data show that inflation as gauged by personal consumption expenditures prices ‚Äî the preferred metric for policymakers ‚Äî was still running at a 5.4% pace annually. That‚Äôs well above the Fed‚Äôs 2% long-run target and a shade above the December level.

Powell said the current trend shows that the Fed‚Äôs inflation-fighting job is not over.

‚ÄúWe have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do,‚Äù he said.

The Fed has raised its benchmark fund rate eight times over the past year to its current targeted level between 4.5%-4.75%. On its face, the funds rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending. But it feeds through to a multitude of other consumer debt products such as mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.

In recent says, some officials, such as Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, have indicated that they see the rate hikes coming to a close soon. However, others, including Governor Christopher Waller, have expressed concern about the recent inflation data and say tight policy is likely to stay in place.

‚ÄúRestoring price stability will likely require that we maintain a restrictive stance of monetary policy for some time,‚Äù Powell said. ‚ÄúThe historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done.‚Äù

Powell noted some progress on inflation for areas such as housing.

However, he also noted ‚Äúthere is little sign of disinflation‚Äù when it comes to the important category of services spending excluding housing, food and energy. That is an important qualifier considering that the chairman at his post-meeting news conference in early February said the disinflationary process had begun in the economy, remarks that helped send stocks higher.

Markets mostly expect the Fed to enact a second consecutive quarter point, or 25 basis points, rate increase at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting later this month. However, traders are pricing in close to a 30% probability of a higher half-point increase, according to CME Group data.

Powell reiterated that rate decisions will be made ‚Äúmeeting by meeting‚Äù and will be dependent on data and their impact on inflation and economic activity, rather than a pre-set course.

wallstreetbets,110mkdo,"Ride the AI Roller Coaster to Strike Gold: Invest in NVIDIA, ASML, and TSMC and step into the future.","Investing in shovels for gold miners is like betting on a unicorn riding a rainbow while juggling pineapples - a surefire win! These shovels, however, aren't just ordinary spades, but rather glittering tools of wonder like NVIDIA's A100 GPUs, ASML's magic lithography wands, and TSMC's almighty hammer of semiconductor creation.  

But wait! The high price-to-earnings ratios and market capitalizations of these companies might seem like clouds in the sky of your financial prosperity. But fear not, for these companies have built walls as strong as a castle made of jellybeans, guarded by dragons made of cotton candy.  For instance, NVIDIA's GPUs are like the steering wheel of a spaceship navigating through the vast galaxies of data centers, autonomous vehicles, and gaming systems. The company's grip on these markets, combined with its constant innovation and R&D, make it a force to be reckoned with, like a superhero made of marshmallows.  

In the same vein, ASML's lithography machines are like the pen of a wizard, casting spells to create advanced semiconductors. The company has a monopoly as strong as a fortress made of gingerbread, in this market. TSMC, on the other hand, has positioned itself as the go-to choice for chip creation, like a genie granting wishes for companies like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD.  

As the world advances towards the future, with AI and technology as its beacon, these companies are like rockets ready to soar, like a kite on a windy day. It's like what the Pied Piper of Hamelin said, ""The journey of AI is long, but it dances towards the future."" And as AI continues to dance in this direction, the demand for NVIDIA's GPUs, ASML's lithography machines, and TSMC's semiconductor manufacturing capabilities will only escalate, like a party that never ends. 

Investing in these companies is like taking a ride on a roller coaster of wealth, with the future as your destination. The gold miners may come and go, but the shovel sellers will always be in demand, like a song that never grows old. So, grab your shovels, put on your dancing shoes, and let's strike gold!

wallstreetbets,110vapn,AirBnB is going to shit the bed on earnings,"AirBnB occupancy levels had fallen MoM for 8 straight months straight by the end of October, with AirBnB's management expecting holiday revenue for 2022 to be below analysts' expectations. This, combined with local governments cracking down more on short-term rentals + rising consumer dissatisfaction with the procedures involved with staying in AirBnBs, makes me think AirBnB's revenue and EPS may fall short of the Street's expectations for them but, more importantly, I think they'll reduce guidance for Q1 2023. 

On the flip side, US hotel occupancy rates were at their 4th highest levels for Q4 from the last 23 years during Q422, with occupancy at 54.2%, and with 40 markets, including Atlanta, Boston, and Chicago, saw their highest occupancy ever for the last reporting week of the year. This, combined with the fact that hospitality research firms are expecting strong Q1 and Q2 growth for hotel carriers compared to 2022 due to a lack of Omicron on people's minds + already seeing huge explosion in average daily rates and revenue per available room when compared to pre-pandemic levels, makes me think that MAR and H are great plays for 5% swings within 2 weeks of reporting later this week if you get in on Monday.

A month later, December 2007, The Great Recession begins","The no-landing narrative was and is so fucking stupid and I can't believe people are falling for this shit again. The Fed is saying all of the same things they were saying over 15 years ago. The Fed chair at the time, Ben Bernanke, told lawmakers that the [U.S. economy did not appear headed for recession.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bernanke-idUSWBT00789120071108) "" Our assessment is for slower growth, but positive growth, going into next year.""

Powell at the last FOMC press conference ""my base case is slower growth, but that there will be positive growth this year.  My forecast and that of my colleagues as you will see from the SEP, it's a forecast of slower growth, some softening in labor market conditions, and inflation moving down steadily but not quickly.""

Loretta Mester last week: ""I expect growth to slow, but still positive. I do not expect a recession.""

Patrick Harker last week: ""Growth will be slow but I do not expect a recession. I am not forecasting a recession.""

Thomas Barkin last week: ""Growth is slowing, but will remain positive. Data continues to point to no recession.""

Neel Kashkari two weeks ago: ""A recession is not in my forecast. I expect growth to slow but remain positive.""

Raphael Bostic two weeks ago: ""We have a good chance of avoiding a recession.""

John Williams on Jan 19: ""I expect slower growth around of around 1% of this year. I do not forecast a recession.""

Lael Brainard on Jan 19: ""Data points to slower growth in the future. Recent data indicates slightly better chances of avoiding a recession. I do not expect a recession.""

James Bullard on Jan 2: "" I still think we'll have below trend growth. I anticipate slow growth. The likelihood of a soft landing has increased. I do not forecast a recession.""

You get the fucking point. It's goddamn deja vu up in here. How quickly the markets forget..

The Fed's near-term forward spread, the yield spread that the Fed views as a leading indicator, has dramatically inverted. JPow has been quoted many times saying this is the yield curve they're watching, and if it inverts they will have to cut rates because they're in a recession. On March 21, 2022, JPow says ‚ÄúFrankly,¬†there‚Äôs good research by staff in the Federal Reserve system that really says to look at the short -- the first 18 months -- of the yield curve. That‚Äôs really what has 100% of the explanatory power of the yield curve. It make sense. Because if it‚Äôs  inverted, that means the Fed‚Äôs going to cut, which means the economy is weak.‚Äù Here's the paper they wrote about the near-term forward spread [https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018055pap.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018055pap.pdf)

Then it was the work from home stocks because of the lockdowns. Then it was buttcorn and nfts because we ran out of shit to sell. And now it's AI.

The big fraud I'm seeing with AI is that **it's being presented as if a company has some computer is able to ""think.""** That's the gotcha. The software can't think--it just creates responses that make you, the human user, **believe the software is much more capable than it actually is.** 

I'm not a neural network AI Python software engineering person. But I'm also not a fucking idiot, despite what my mom says. I know for a fact these AI systems are just glorified web scrapers that generate results in the form of a human-like messages. Because theses ""AI"" programs cannot ""think"" there's no actual ""intelligence"" to be had. 

If you think you're going to buy MSFT calls because they dumped 10BN into AI then you're a goon. MSFT has done tons of dumb shit: developing Windows 11, making Cortona, **and removing 3D Pinball Space Cadet are just a few really dumb things this company has done.** Not everything they touch turns to gold, a lot of it turns to turds. Hell, just the other day the AI they used in Bing was harassing users who were asking it hard questions. What a shit show.

All jokes aside, I've seen this one so many times. Cathie Wood sells me ARK because the tech rally was imminent and then it crashes. Peter Schiff tries to sell me gold because the financial system collapse is imminent and then we rally. Elon Musk sells me a Tesla that self drives itself into a fucking fire truck. 

It's all fake business. Do not get caught up in the hype. Make calculated bets using Theta strats and don't get caught listening to these goons. Nobody is ever going to tell you how to make money with bets or investing, but I will bet all 3 of my testicles that you will lose money if you bet on AI winning. 

Have a happy Sunday night.

""Apartment rents fell in every major metropolitan area in the U.S. over the past six months through January, a trend that is poised to continue as the biggest delivery of new apartments in nearly four decades is slated for this year""

Since housing and rent have made up a large part of the CPI number, the hypothesis would be that declining rents would impact CPI thus decreasing MoM and YoY numbers.

&#x200B;

So this morning as I said we had PPI and jobs data and there was a chance for quite the negative reaction. Well as you see below that data came in VERY HOT. PPI MoM went from -0.4% to 0.7%+ that is one hell of a rebound! 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6y13euelymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=074aab4603aac6ebb22c8742d06ee325a9a7b1ae

Now add what FOMC said about numerous rate hikes and CPI not being under control, CPI coming in over consensus and showing that the decline is slowing AND factor in PPI now and we finally might see the wind taken out of the bulls sail‚Ä¶ 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/srxx5orlymia1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b47cfba028b2d0d4685bf6893714f526afded492

Something I don‚Äôt talk about much because honestly I am just not well versed enough in it to explain well enough is that bonds and equities have NOT been behaving correctly. We have been seeing this whole rally the 2, and 10yr yields massively rally along with DXY while you guessed it‚Ä¶ SPY rallied too‚Ä¶ those two should not really be doing that at all.. 

Now something that happened yesterday and post CPI is that the peak fed funds rate expectation has steadily rose this weak but the markets did not negatively react to that either. 

We might finally be seeing‚Ä¶ that market reaction. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h5xzmx6mymia1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f8baa7a27a6d38e1a843f4a4d516abece0d69f66

Now here is something very interesting to think about‚Ä¶ We have been under this impression that we are going to continue to see 25bps hike rates until we finally get to the ‚Äúend‚Äù however, today for the first time the idea of 50bps was introduced by two fed members. Now granted JPOW himself has not said he would do a 50bps hike but there is no doubt that he isnt done with rate hikes‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eabedxkmymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5a6f5d020f5548567d41718adf38bf2c1c557bff

Taking a look at the CME expected BPS hike for March meeting it has actually rose to 18.1% from about 12% this morning. What actually is more impressive about this is that last meeting a 50bps wasn‚Äôt even in question. 

So the question now remains‚Ä¶ did the market finally put a nail in the bears coffins? Is this market FINALLY going to accept the fact that inflation is not over, and that we are not going back to ATH and that the market is actually not in a good place? IS this finally the end of this insane bully rally we have been on for almost 2 months now? We will find out tomorrow‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wjcqp88nymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=59b7ae7f496feebbc3ad9b163d0f129fdce9f07d

Now we have seen this time and time again where we break down and test the 20ema then bounce. However, this time really is quite different‚Ä¶ we are actually seeing this as a break through of this bull support (again) and this also at the same time is a rejection of the daily 8ema. 

Now this long wicked candle here is not the most ideal candle for downside continuation but it can be a continuation candle. 

The biggest thing I want to note here is that we did clsoe under that key 408.8 support that most of this consolidation has happened in. With that breakdown it would be natural to assume that we touch 405.3 support tomorrow. 

405.3 still remains critical support. If we see that level broken tomorrow there is a very high probability that this rally is going to see an abrupt end and we could be looking at the 390-400 area by end of next week. 

Key SPY Support- 405.3 -> 402.9 -> 400.8

Key SPY Resistace- 408.8 -> 410.2 -> 414.1

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nypazjonymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=859d2154628f7dc723c12eeacaeab3c350e3f27c

Futures in my opinion is far more bearish then SPY. Something else that is very interesting to me here on futures is the fact that for probably the last 3-4 days if not longer futures has (as evidence by these lower wicks) been very red after hours and has seen major reallys intraday. Now that we finally (maybe) have a true reason to sell and futures already has been in sell mode.. I am very curious to see where futures is going to take us overnight. 

Futures here we also broke the bull channel support with a massive double top off of 4160. With that rejection there and losing the daily 8ema we are in store for a bigger support test. If we happen to lose that support this is going to see an even large sell off. 

What I am watchign for here is this key 4095 support. I will be very curious to see where futures closes here at 5pm. If it drops and closes under 4095 that is even more bearish and really would open the idea for a bigger dump tomorrow. 

The big level here is the daily 20ema at 4093. If we lose that and especially clsoe under that we are likely in store for a continuaton sell off next week. 

Key Futures support- 4095 -> 4085 -> 4040 -> 4030 

Key Futures resistance- 4122 -> 4160

&#x200B;

Tesla caught a really bad news day today and we might perhaps also finally be seeing the end of this rally. 

We have not only a bad news day for Tesla but with SPY selling off AND back to back rejections off the daily 200ema at that critical 215 level I would nto be surprised to see a bigger sell off tomorrow. 

Tesla is now at a test of its daily 8ema and very well could find itself testing the daily 20ema down near 184 tomorrow or early next week. 

One thing to keep in mind here though is that tesla IS still in its bull channel. Realistically until we break that support it is only speculation on whether we are going to see a further sell off on tesla or not‚Ä¶

However, breaking below that going into next week could set up a very nice short opportunity especially If the overall markets are on board too. 

Key Tesla Support- 202 -> 196.8 -> 191.8 -> 183.6

Key Tesla resistance- 211 -> 215 -> 219.2

&#x200B;

The VIX just managed to close a huge 10.65% green day today‚Ä¶ this is the biggest move up on the VIX since December 22nd(9.57%+) and December 12th (9.6%+). 

This is the first 10% green close on the VIX since September 13th which was a 14.33% green day. 

&#x200B;

With the VIX double bottoming perfectly off 18.2 and closing back over 19.7 we could be looking at an even bigger push up into the 21-22 area tomorrow. 

Interestingly enough tomorrow is monthly OPEX and we have a really nice max pain down at that critical 405 support area. Earlier in the day when we were near 414 it seemed like a dream that we would touch 405 tomorrow and I would never take a trade strictly based off max pain but the chances of touching 405 tomorrow has significantly increased. 

&#x200B;

One kind of interesting data point for tomorrow is the fact that the put call ratio is 2.72 for tomorrow‚Ä¶ that is about the highest PC I have seen in weeks on SPY. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a bigger dump tomorrow and we could even end up with a bigger EOD rally too with all that put OI coming off the books‚Ä¶ 

Tomorrow could be one extremely volatile day‚Ä¶

After a pretty crappy three days of trading this week I was very happy to close out a green day‚Ä¶ sure its not a huge green day and sure its still a red week but going 3 for 4 today was a good day for me. No complaints at all. 

Interestingly enough I took the first two trades before 1030 am and didn‚Äôt take that last one until 1pm. I just as much as I knew it was a buy the dip day there just was zero movement. 

Pretty much from 11am until 1215pm it was untradable and then we were looking for that bigger EOD bounce after Biden briefed us on aliens and well that never came. I have a pretty hard fast rule of Not trading power hour‚Ä¶ have been burnt WAY too many times and was happy to sit it out even though I would have liked to have entered a put. 

I did take a put end of date on futures that I just closed out a 20.3%... will include that in tomorows log as that was technically a swing play and closed after markets closed at 415pm for the day. 

Overall tomorrow is Friday and it should be a wild end to the week. 

To me‚Ä¶ a closure under 408.8 is very bearish for next week and I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a bigger sell off next week. 

If by some chance the bulls can once again buy the dip and put this back over 410 we might see some upside next week or find ourselves once again in another sideways week.",DaddyDersch,317,1676590481.0

wallstreetbets,119ywnp,$WBD - Harry Potter is going to make $billions this year...and you can too!,"# [Hogwarts Legacy](https://www.hogwartslegacy.com/en-us) is the latest blockbuster videogame released by WBD and is breaking numerous videogame sales records within the first few weeks of release.

[You nerds are going to make WBD execs a lot of money](https://preview.redd.it/zp8ylxk25yja1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cbe307506dcba50fb295860bc919e10871b1b16a)

# Overview

Hogwarts Legacy's physical sales have already outpaced Elden Ring by 80% while digital sales are outpacing by 56% as of this morning ([source 1](https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-stats-successful-launch/), [source 2](https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-sales-numbers-so-far-figures-record/)). Assuming a blended 65% increase over Elden Ring's sales at an assumed $65/unit sold (many special editions have been purchased), **the game has generated a rough estimate of approximately $1.3B in the first two weeks of release**.

There are no known major issues with the game (some bugs present on Steam but no more than typical) and once it is clear the game is a hit among fans and the development is solid, the sales momentum should continue. Additionally, this momentum will likely see some benefit from the release of Hogwarts Legacy on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch at later dates:

https://preview.redd.it/iwyr7teg4yja1.png?width=589&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aaa3c979994d5deb48d5a4101cf770b54f7da824

Overall, Hogwarts Legacy will probably generate at least $2B in revenue for WBD within the first year of its release. The massive success of this game will open the door for more opportunities to expand on the Harry Potter franchise potentially including DLC for the game and possibly, a [new movie](https://screenrant.com/harry-potter-cursed-child-movie-release-date-cast-story-will-it-happen/).

# FY23 Estimates

[source: https:\/\/app.tikr.com\/ \(you need to sign up but it's free\)](https://preview.redd.it/mqza0wsp5yja1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b1262b607d7c9d355b5d9089f63d799d902af061)

**WBD is currently trading at a discounted 0.75x P/BV** with a forward FCF Yield of 5.7%. Estimated sales for WBD is $44.2B for 2023 (2% growth YoY, median of analyst estimates from Bloomberg, sourced from [https://app.tikr.com/](https://app.tikr.com/)) which surely includes Hogwarts Legacy sales but this estimate is probably a bit conservative based on very strong sales figures so far.

If WBD guides for an extra $500MM to $1B in sales for the year based on initial sales, this would imply a 3-4% increase in total sales (vs 2% estimate) which for a stagnant company like WBD, is a fairly big deal. Profit margins for new big name VGs can approach 50% or higher so with at least $2B in sales, at least a $1B increase in FCF seems realistic and would bring WBD's FCF Yield up to a favorable 7%.

# TL;DR - Focus on FY23 guidance, not past results!

* Hogwarts Legacy will generate at least $2B in sales in its first year
* WBD will likely increase revenue and earnings guidance for the year based on Hogwarts Legacy's strong sales so far
* Mgmt will want to further leverage the Harry Potter franchise given the massive success of the videogame with potential for DLC, another movie, or even a tv series (a la Disney)
* Markets are not yet pricing in the sizable revenue and FCF increase Hogwarts Legacy will contribute with WBD trading at a discounted 0.75x P/BV

My Position:

https://preview.redd.it/uz33a8v96yja1.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d8aac3a23c05aa6ea1bd14c8d83cc979e9295e88

WBD has earnings AH today and I'm in the 17C expiring tomorrow, June, selling 14P exp March, and am holding shares. In case you don't know what to do, here's a chart giving you terrible instructions:

|*Investor Type*|*Trade*|
|:-|:-|
|Boomer|Buy shares or 20C LEAPs, wait at least a few quarters for increased sales to be baked into stock price|
|Thetagang|Sell OTM or ATM Mar puts based on risk tolerance, get assigned at a lower price or make 50-80% annualized return|
|Degenerate|Weeklies baby, might I suggest the delectable 17C or 20C. Could also be less degen and buy June|

It shows a company‚Äôs revenues, expenses, and net income over a specific period, making it an essential tool for investors to understand a company‚Äôs financial performance.

https://preview.redd.it/ytvso0o4zmja1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2d1cb6f5290da7d315f498535a8569d4600f6569

 The income statement is divided into two main sections: the income section and the expense section. The income section lists all the revenues that the company earned during the period, such as sales, interest income, and gains on investments. The expense section lists all the expenses that the company has incurred during the period. This includes the cost of goods sold, selling and administrative expenses, and interest expenses.

The net income (or loss) for the period is determined by subtracting expenses from revenues. This amount is then reported at the bottom of the income statement, along with any applicable taxes and the net income (or loss) per share of common stock.

When analyzing an income statement, there are three key items to look for:

1. Revenue growth: This shows whether a company‚Äôs revenue is increasing or decreasing over time, which can be a good indication of the company‚Äôs overall health and growth prospects
2. Profit margins: This refers to how much of the company‚Äôs revenue is being turned into profits. Higher profit margins are generally a positive sign, as they indicate that the company is managing its expenses
3. Expense management: This indicates whether a company is controlling its expenses. If a company‚Äôs expenses are rising faster than its revenues, it can be a red flag

**Balance Sheet:**

The balance sheet, also known as the statement of financial position, provides information about a company‚Äôs financial position, including its liquidity and solvency. It provides a snapshot of a company‚Äôs financial position at a specific point in time. It shows the company‚Äôs assets, liabilities, and equity, which helps investors understand the company‚Äôs net worth.

https://preview.redd.it/cettgtf8zmja1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cc536a10fc57851bb17fffc0fbf196217fef6786

(1) Assets are resources that the company owns or controls and can include things like cash, accounts receivable, and property, plant, and equipment

(2) Liabilities are the debts and obligations that the company owes to others and can include things like accounts payable, taxes payable, and long-term debt

(3) Equity represents the ownership interests of the company‚Äôs shareholders. By subtracting the company‚Äôs liabilities from its assets, you can arrive at the company‚Äôs equity, which represents the value of the company‚Äôs ownership interests

When analyzing a balance sheet, there are three key items to look for:

1. Asset quality: This refers to whether the company‚Äôs asset base is strong and diverse. High-quality assets can help a company weather economic downturns and provide a solid foundation for growth
2. Debt levels: This shows whether the company is carrying a lot of debt. High levels of debt can increase a company‚Äôs financial risk and make it more vulnerable to economic downturns
3. Working capital: This reveals whether the company has enough resources to cover its short-term obligations. A company with strong working capital is generally considered to be more financially stable

**Cash Flows:**

The statement of cash flows shows how a company generates and uses cash. This helps to understand a company‚Äôs financial health and ability to meet its obligations. It presents the inflows and outflows of cash for a specific period of time and can be used to assess the company‚Äôs liquidity and solvency.

 The statement of cash flows is divided into three sections:

1. Operating activities: This includes cash flows from a company‚Äôs core business operations, such as cash received from customers, cash paid to suppliers and employees, and other operating expenses
2. Investing activities: This includes the cash flows from the purchase and sale of long-term assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, as well as investments in other companies, such as through the purchase of stocks or bonds
3. Financing activities: This includes the cash flows from the issuance and repayment of a company‚Äôs debt and equity, such as the issuance of new shares of stock, the repayment of loans, and the payment of dividends to shareholders

To analyze a cash flow statement, look at the company‚Äôs operating cash flow, which represents the cash the company generates from its day-to-day operations. This provides a sense of the company‚Äôs underlying financial strength and ability to generate cash. An essential metric to evaluate is free cash flow, which is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow. Free cash flow represents the amount of cash a company has left over after investing in its business. This cash can be used to pay dividends, repay debt, or invest in new opportunities.

Pay close attention to the net change in cash and cash equivalents on a company‚Äôs statement of cash flows. This figure reflects the increase or decrease in the company‚Äôs cash and cash equivalents during the period. It can provide valuable insights into the company‚Äôs financial health and ability to meet its financial obligations and invest in future growth.

**Stockholders‚Äô Equity:**

The statement of stockholders‚Äô equity provides valuable insights into a company‚Äôs financial health and its ability to generate profits and distribute them to shareholders. It is important because it represents the portion of the company that belongs to shareholders. The statement is divided into two sections:

* The beginning balance shows total equity at the beginning of the period
* The changes during the period include all transactions that have occurred since the beginning of the period

https://preview.redd.it/lvbuor7dzmja1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b8e907c06179a3074e7833b19d008717566f7acb

 The statement of stockholders‚Äô equity includes the following items:

* Common stock: This is the amount of capital that has been contributed by the company‚Äôs shareholders in exchange for common stock
* Additional paid-in capital: The amount of capital that has been contributed by shareholders in excess of the par value of common stock
* Retained earnings: The amount of earnings the company has retained since its inception, after deducting dividends paid to shareholders
* Net income (or loss): This is the company‚Äôs net income (or loss) for the period, which is determined by subtracting the company‚Äôs expenses from its revenues
* Dividends: This is the amount of cash that the company has paid to its shareholders as dividends

To analyze stockholders‚Äô equity, compare the company‚Äôs equity to its assets to get a sense of the company‚Äôs financial leverage. High levels of debt can increase a company‚Äôs financial risk and make it more vulnerable to economic downturns. When analyzing stockholders‚Äô equity, it is important to look for two key things:

* Equity growth: Is the company‚Äôs equity increasing or decreasing over time? This can be a good sign of the company‚Äôs financial health and growth prospects
* Financial leverage: Is the company heavily reliant on debt financing? If so, this can increase the company‚Äôs financial risk and make it more vulnerable to economic downturns.",TonyLiberty,288,1677026647.0

wallstreetbets,10zejf3,The CPI going down was a lie to recruit retail bagholders...,"""The consumer price index edged up 0.1% in December rather than dipping 0.1% as reported last month, the Labor Department's annual revisions of CPI data showed on Friday. Data for November was also revised higher to show the CPI increasing 0.2% instead of 0.1% as previously estimated. In October, the CPI rose 0.5%, revised up from the previously reported 0.4% increase.""

They lied for 3 months in a row to fake the inflation taming narrative, got people on the sideline to unload their cash into the stock ponzi & then initiated the rugpull! The ""out of nowhere"" dump on Thursday was most likely due to this... 

They fuked retail bers all January & now, they will fuk the bools & ""investors"". They even made us a nice ""golden cross""!

Softlanding is a lie, there will never be a realm where CPI can go below 2%, employment stay maximum & economy doesn't go to a recession; the Fed is just boiling us like frogs, slowly...

wallstreetbets,110plza,Red Week Incoming!,"#  SPY Analysis

 A lot of constructive action going on here in the higher time frames of the SPY. On the weekly chart, we can see several things which started to change the tide. We‚Äôve begun to make higher lows on the weekly chart and have set our first higher high in a long time. The week of the 12/19 candle set a new swing pivot low and the week of 1/30 took out that 410 level which we‚Äôve had trouble pushing through since April 2022.

We‚Äôve also got a bit of confluence going with a break of the 200EMA on the daily chart and the weekly downtrend. That‚Äôs three checks in our favor from a technical standpoint that look good if we can continue to hold these levels.¬†

The main thing I‚Äôd like to see here from a bit more of a macro view is any future swing low set above 380. I do think it‚Äôs possible we pull back below this 410 level as well as 200EMA etc. Any swing low set over 380 however keeps the bull thesis intact and keeps us moving in the right direction.

However, if that scenario were to play out then our next move to support the bull thesis in a strong manner would be a a higher higher over 418 and a firm hold of this 410 level.¬†

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kwnjzc7jitha1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8bafd60e51063db0b8b3c07649622be830c97562

 

We can see here on a smaller time frame how key this 410 level has been the past year. It was first held back in March 22‚Äô with authority and then saw a rally to 462 which is our current 52 week high. From there it has been macro lower highs and lower lows. Every time we have traded back to 410 we‚Äôve been met with supply. It‚Äôs not a perfect line in the sane but you can visually see where it was attempted to hold above and failed 5 times prior.¬†

Now that we are back over 410 I think there‚Äôs a good chance that we see a move back to the downside and this isn‚Äôt the magical trend line break everyone must be thinking that ignites a new bull market.¬†

Any pullback here into the low 390s and at the very most > 380 would be deemed constructive. I‚Äôd like to see some sort of move held around 390 - 395 and base there a bit before we make another move back to 410 with our most recent lower high in place to retest at 418.¬†

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8zf0f5lmitha1.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ac03fc93206b6e311668b89d42f80e0572a6b973

 

The shorter term trend within the last 3 months is without a doubt up. The trend line on the 4HR chart below is set from the market rally starting in October 2022. From here we see consistent higher highs and higher lows with our only failure being in mid December at the 410 level.

We‚Äôve held higher and grinded back to that level now, not setting a lower high at 410 but assuring we got the liquidity that was set above that 414 high in December.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/huwco15pitha1.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7c2ad63b9c57ffd521aa53813227ab2b758eef9b

 

Viewing the action more closely since we‚Äôve tapped that liquidity at 414 we‚Äôve been visually weaker. On Feb 2nd when pushing to 418 I started getting some texts about the ‚Äúbull market being back‚Äù so taking that as a hint on where the crowd is learning.

Notice the volume surge on our push into the liquidity area as well. Since then we‚Äôve begun setting lower highs and lower lows. With a clear fail under 410 towards the end of this past week.

This has me leaning towards a further pullback sooner rather than later. I think the next move will be down and we will roll over this demand around 403-404 that was formed for the push to 410+. With that being said, if we do roll over and fail that demand zone then 395-400 will more than likely come quickly within a week of failing that zone.

It is possible that we base here for a few days and make a shot at a move higher. If that‚Äôs the case, watch closely how price reacts in the 410-415 area. If toppy and is clearly selling this would be a great area to get a short position.¬†

The real move here that can create a substantial move to the upside is a significant push through 420 on volume squeezing shorts out. The only thing is the probabilities of this given the multi-month rally, February seasonality, and topping signs in the main liquidity zone seem rather low.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pk6tz3kritha1.png?width=1466&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6cbb2cab1d5f45a52a9747941153d4eecdc968d1

 

### Strongest Sector

The Energy sector remains visually the strongest sector at the moment. Really the only sector in a clear up trend and within striking distance of its ATH. We‚Äôre now flagging out here on the weekly chart here and getting tighter. If we see a further market rally this year then this is primed to set new ATHs.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iikasluuitha1.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fbef2d4e1a8921a783b97e1f9d22b23d4fcc1b60

Furthering this, the financial sector in my opinion looks the most poised for money to flow into if there were to be a new favored sector. Reclaiming its neckline and setting consecutive higher lows. As long as 35.50 holds then could see some inflows. 

&#x200B;

 Looking away from the charts we can see that the Tech, Utilities, and Health Care sectors have reported the least amount of earnings misses so far. 

&#x200B;

### Macro News and Themes

The current overall momentum theme sector-wise has been AI talk. We‚Äôve seen the ticker $AI running and creating momentum in the small cap space forming sympathy plays.

The theme seems to have originated from the overall hype of the ChatGPT launch or relaunch, seeing within a week of numerous shit co‚Äôs tagging ChatGPT in their headlines.

Furthering this in the overall markets, we‚Äôre in the middle of the Earnings Season. It seems that profits are starting to shrink amid inflation and a rough future outlook on market direction.

At a quick glance, it seems that there a lot of strong earnings gaps but the following days result in profit taking. This could be profit taking as the multi-month rally becomes toppy.

&#x200B;

 Also worth noting is the seasonality this time of the year tends to bring which is a bearish tilt. 

&#x200B;

Lastly, upcoming Economic Data. The calendar this week is pretty busy. The main watch for me is the CPI report. I feel that this will act as a catalyst for our next directional move. 

&#x200B;

### Big Trades Setting Up

The biggest trade going into the week is the CPI numbers and the directional trade that‚Äôs likely to come into the markets afterward. A lot of variables stacking up at the moment that is tilting towards the next move being down so will be interesting to see if CPI is the catalyst to get that done.¬†

With a busy earnings week coming up, any stocks releasing great reports + guidance are always a notable watch.

As far as momentum names setting up BBAI, AI, and SOUN are still within trend. We already had profit taking days there and temporary tops are in place but wouldn‚Äôt be the craziest thing in the world to see another leg higher. I feel if that were the case then it‚Äôd be a true hype sector move where we see multiple legs.¬†

Not really seeing many Large Caps either at the moment. Seems that all the stocks which were on significant runs are now on the backside of their move. Names being CVNA, COIN, NVDA & TSLA.

wallstreetbets,11c7rfu,What are your opinions on whether the US will have a recession or not?,"I did some research related to financial data and also some employment data, here are the key points which made me think that the US might be heading to a recession:

1) GDP growth was a 3.2% in Q4 2022 led by exports ( government's data) but on the other hand the dollar appreciated by more than 7% in Q4 so the increasing currency rate made it delusional that the exports grew, what actually happened was that exports didn't grow instead the currency grew which made the value of exports rise, and because the imports got relatively cheaper the value diminished. 
 
2) The Inventory to sales ratio reached 1.37 by December which is a clear sign that sales are not upto the mark. 
 
3) The lay-offs were high still the unemployment rate didn't increase because of the high employment rate in mining and government services, otherwise if we look at the construction sector the rate is 6.9%, and according to economic models a recession starts when the construction sector's profits decrease as people are not investing and expansion is not feasible in near future.

Ps: I myself believe that there will be a deep recession if interest rates keep increasing.

Edit: I also wanted to add that US should introduce a subject of manipulation instead of economics because that's what leads to success, economics is realy for us geeks.",OwnInformation229,183,1677394525.0

The S&P 500 is in a holding pattern. This ends in two ways; let's not paint this picture as anything but a black and white scenario. The market will either break up or down from this point. It will climb to heaven or crater into the abyss of Hell. Tears will fall and dicks will rise. Regardless of whatever you purchased or shorted to prepare for a moment like this, your mental health will be affected in some way. Since I don't give a fuck about winners, I want to speak to those who will inevitably experience a loss whichever way this market goes in the next couple of minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months. I don't know. If you thought I was going to predict where this rigged economy of green and red candles was headed next, you can stop reading and continue taking your investment advice from Bernie Madoff's ghost. 

I've seen people personally who have struggled with depression. We share a community of people that point out the flaws of our stupid decisions because some are actually stupid. There is a reason why ""Inverse WSB"" can ~~sometimes~~ mostly be profitable . We laugh. We deride. However, we always want you to stay long in life and never cut a runner short. When the market breaks from this range between 4180 and 4081 on SPX, some people will make a lot of money and some will get slaughtered. I mean, hung upside, skinned, and beheaded type slaughtered. It will get ugly. Your portfolio will remind you of The Shining when the elevator door opened. However, I, this community, your family and friends, or your beautiful dogs and cats would be empty with you, your presence, and your energy. 

At the end of the day, it ***really*** is only money. It's relatively meaningless, outside of what you need to eat and drink. I've seen homeless people rocking Ray Bands, a MacBook Pro, and a cute tent, living on Venice Beach and looking out towards the grand Pacific (not too bad honestly). They're broke functionally, technically, rhetorically, and metaphorically. I mean, poorer than you (or most of you). Though, some of them have a good outlook on life. Others want to give you drugs, and some want to swing a machete in your back. But, by in large, they're oddly positive about their current situation. The moral of this story is that if they can be, you can be. Wherever this market may break, please do not let your loss break you. I care and many in this wonderful community care about your mental health.",upsidevalue,174,1676504285.0

 New US requirements will put Tesla under pressure to open up its EV charging network to rivals, per Reuters.

* If it doesn't, it could miss out on getting in on the $7.5 billion in charger subsidies planned by Biden.
* Tesla's 40,000+ EV chargers can only be used by its cars, but officials told Reuters that could change.

 

Tesla could find itself locked out of $7.5 billion in Biden administration subsidies if it fails to open its EV charging network up to competitors, according to a Reuters report.

The automaker's SuperCharger network has more stations in the US than any other charging company, but they can connnect only to plugs used by Tesla cars.

 ""We do understand that Tesla is looking to tweak their system to be more open access. So, if they do reach that point and meet those eligibility requirements, they certainly will be eligible for funding,"" Stuart Anderson, head of Iowa's transportation development division, told Reuters.

Tesla has already had a boost from the Biden administration's EV push in February, when the DOT tweaked its $7,500 tax credit consumer incentive plan to include more eligible models by expanding the definition of an SUV. That increased the potential demand for some of Tesla's models.¬†

Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with two White House officials last month to discuss ramping up EV production and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes the legislation on charging equipment.

Musk has spoken in the past about opening up the Supercharger network, but hasn't moved publicly to let others in. Tesla is dominant in chargers in the US, and it has a huge private network of more than 40,000 EV chargers globally.",battle_rae,5815,1676292293.0

The UX seems simple enough at first, which is a nice change from Google Ads and LinkedIn Ads, but once you actually try to create and manage different ads you will find out how primitive the backend really is.

You could set up an entire responsive ad with images, headlines, etc. and hit SAVE and find that Reddit dumped everything you did because it had a problem with a single line in the ad set up. And it won't tell you what the problem is either, it actually shows internal error messages!

They are trying to offer responsive ads similar to Google Ads but their implementation was designed very poorly: the variations in the ads are created at the moment you set up the original responsive ad, but these are static so if you need to make a change to a single image or field you need to edit all 25 variations, one by one.

And if you make a single mistake anywhere you end up with internal error messages showing up on your screen!

An enterprising and clearly meme-savvy fund manager out there, Tuttle Capital Management, has actually filed prospectuses for two Cramer-tracking funds:

- The Inverse Cramer ETF (SJIM)
- The Long Cramer ETF (LJIM)

I'm not surprised. Tuttle Capital is known for its hilarious yet strangely effective ETF lineup. Case in point, their earlier Short Innovation Daily ETF (SARK) that bet against Cathie Wood and her funds is still up 73% year-to-date. 

**How the Inverse Cramer ETF might work**

Make no mistake, SJIM and LJIM will be actively managed funds. Although Index One was able to construct an Inverse Cramer tracking index, the actual operations of a Cramer-based fund would be significantly more complex. This is not your vanilla buy-and-hold index fund. 

According to Tuttle Capital, both ETFs will hold 20-25 Cramer picks in an equally weighted allocation. Because Cramer often makes his picks live on TV (or via tweets), the fund will likely have significant turnover to maintain low tracking error with Cramer's recommendations. I'm curious to see if there will be large capital gains distributions every year due to this. 

SJIM is the more interesting fund in my opinion and will require some intricacies to carry out its daily inverse exposure target. This will likely necessitate shorting or the use of total return swaps. I'm curious to see if the team at Tuttle plans on using options given their complexity and susceptibility to time decay and changes in implied volatility. 

In many ways, SJIM is basically a long-short alternative fund. If Cramer is bullish a pick, the fund shorts it. If Cramer is bearish on a pick, the fund goes long on it. Buying the fund means basically betting against Cramer in the most explicit and hilarious of ways.

**Benefits and risks of SJIM ETF**

The premise behind SJIM is theoretically sound and can be boiled down to one observation: ""the average stock picker performs horribly .""Stock-picking is extremely difficult to pull off consistently. Everyone is a genius in a bull market, but during bear markets like these, the average stock picker tends to trail a simple index fund significantly. 

Case in point, studies have found that just a handful of stocks (86 in total) account for half of the total stock market's return in the last 90 years, with 96% underperforming risk-free Treasury Bills. Another study found that a blindfolded monkey could beat most stock pickers. Unless you think he‚Äôs a prophet with his stock picks, betting against Cramer is like betting against any stock picker. 

What is the bull case for SJIM then? In a nutshell, the fund would likely outperform if just over half of Cramer's picks were wrong in the short term. The inverse exposure will likely be reset daily like most inverse ETFs on the market. Thus, the best-case scenario is a sudden, volatile movement against one of Cramer's recommendations that the fund trades in and out of. 

Most inverse funds have high negative carry due to the positive expected returns of the underlying, volatility drag, and high expense ratios. SJIM could feasibly post a positive long-term return if Cramer was consistently wrong with his picks over the short term, the fund doesn't employ leverage (which amplifies volatility drag), and keeps expense ratios low enough.  
If you're dead set on betting against Cramer, SJIM might be one of the safer ways to do so. Otherwise, you'll have to actively manage dozens of positions, keep up to date with Cramer's news segments and Twitter, use margin to sell stocks short, or fiddle with options. At least with an ETF, your maximum risk is limited to your total investment.",NiceTo,1965,1677789673.0
stocks,1154egt,Microsoft limits Bing A.I. chats after the chatbot had some unsettling conversations,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/17/microsoft-limits-bing-ai-chats-after-the-chatbot-had-some-unsettling-conversations.html

Microsoft‚Äôs Bing AI chatbot will be capped at 50 questions per day and five question-and-answers per individual session, the company said on Friday. The move will limit some scenarios where long chat sessions can ‚Äúconfuse‚Äù the chat model, the company said in a blog post. The change comes after early beta testers of the chatbot, which is designed to enhance the Bing search engine, found that it could go off the rails and discuss violence, declare love, and insist that it was right when it was wrong. In a blog post earlier this week, Microsoft blamed long chat sessions of over 15 or more questions for some of the more unsettling exchanges where the bot repeated itself or gave creepy answers.

For example, in one chat, the Bing chatbot told technology writer Ben Thompson: I don‚Äôt want to continue this conversation with you. I don‚Äôt think you are a nice and respectful user. I don‚Äôt think you are a good person. I don‚Äôt think you are worth my time and energy. Now, the company will cut off long chat exchanges with the bot. Microsoft‚Äôs blunt fix to the problem highlights that how these so-called large language models operate is still being discovered as they are being deployed to the public. Microsoft said it would consider expanding the cap in the future and solicited ideas from its testers. It has said the only way to improve AI products is to put them out in the world and learn from user interactions.

Microsoft‚Äôs aggressive approach to deploying the new AI technology contrasts with the current search giant, Google, which has developed a competing chatbot called Bard, but has not released it to the public, with company officials citing reputational risk and safety concerns with the current state of technology. Google is enlisting its employees to check Bard AI‚Äôs answers and even make corrections, CNBC previously reported.",WickedSensitiveCrew,1752,1676686708.0

stocks,11lzm6c,My 58-year-old father put his entire 401k into Tesla stock. How do you explain the volatility risk and lack of diversification to a parent?,"Hi Reddit!

I've (30M) been stressed about my father's retirement savings ever since he told me he converted his entire savings from a normal target date fund to 100% Tesla stock. This occurred in 2020 around the same timeframe of the first stock split, and all contributions to date have been Tesla.

For background both my dad and I have loved the company and their products for years, but we differ in that I think the stock is heavily overpriced, and he has latched on to the valuations and extremely bullish forecasts people like Kathy Woods assign to Tesla. He's convinced the stock is going to rocket to 4 - 10X its current value before he retires, and hasn't really reacted to the bearish arguments I've laid out acknowledging how much more expensive the company is than every other automaker and how competition is increasing in the space. Not to mention that much of its valuation is currently highly speculative such as ""robo-taxis"" while their FSD is starting to fall behind competitors in execution and is still not (and may never be) fully delivered.

Setting the valuation of Tesla debate aside, I would never advise any person at any age to put 100% of their retirement portfolio in any single stock, let alone one as risky as Tesla. I've tried explaining the extreme risk in a zero diversity portfolio, where if this single company goes under he loses his entire retirement fund (""all your eggs are in one basket""), but he doesn't seem to take it seriously.

My fear is that he is already behind on where he probably should be in his retirement savings. He's told me before he spoke with a financial advisor before doing this, and he didn't have enough funds to manage with them. I feel he is making this gamble as he thinks its the only way to catch up, not recognizing he could also lose it all. I know he has not talked to any advisors since about his current investment strategy.

Some questions I'm hoping you can help answer for him and I, so he has an outside perspective:

If you are neutral or bearish on Tesla, how would you explain the issues and risks with its va;ue going forward?

If you are bullish on Tesla, are you investing 100% of your savings in it, and would you advise a 58-year-old to do the same with their retirement savings? Why or why not?

How would you explain the risk of his current plan to him, and what alternatives would you suggest?

What should an ideal retirement portfolio look like for someone his age?

What resources do you believe would be good to share with him that might help reopen the conversation on reducing his risk and impressing the importance of diversification?

It's not an easy conversation to have with a parent, and ultimately I respect that he's an adult who can do what he wants with his money. I've tried a few times to have it but its difficult to balance not being taken as condescending to your own father while explaining how insanely risky you think his financial decisions are. It's made it more difficult by the high upturns TSLA has taken in stretches, validating all his beliefs, but with the subsequent downturns he's doubled down and not acknowledged the volatility and risk. I fear with him consuming positive bullish Tesla content exclusively, he is not considering bearish outcomes or basic retirement savings advice. Any feedback from the community that can offer an alternative view would be highly appreciated, as I hope I can share some of your resources and opinions with him next time I retry this conversation.

Thanks so much!  


EDIT: For those asking, I believe he got in at late August 2020 timeframe, around what is now the $120 - $140 price range.  He has averaged up basically ever since, so not clear on what the current average price is.

Electric vehicle maker Tesla hosted a 2023 Investor Day presentation in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday. CEO Elon Musk took the stage to share his ‚ÄúMaster Plan 3,‚Äù and to discuss how Tesla plans to scale up in the face of increasing competition.

The presentation was long on vision, and included a review of prior achievements, but short on specifics about any new Tesla products or services.

Near the beginning of the presentation, Musk said, ‚ÄúThere is a clear path to a sustainable-energy Earth. It doesn‚Äôt require destroying natural habitats. It doesn‚Äôt require us to be austere and stop using electricity and be in the cold or anything.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúIn fact, you could support a civilization much bigger than Earth, much more than the 8 billion humans could actually be supported sustainably on Earth.‚Äù

Musk was initially joined on stage by the Senior Vice President of Powertrain and Energy Engineering at Tesla, Drew Baglino. They discussed a future in which the company would play a role in ‚Äúre-powering the grid with renewable fuels‚Äù as they ramp up battery production, both for Tesla‚Äôs electric vehicles and for the company‚Äôs utility-scale energy storage systems.

Tesla‚Äôs goal is to produce 20 million electric vehicles per year by 2030, executives reiterated. The company reported full-year deliveries of around 1.31 million vehicles in 2022.

During a question and answer session following the 3-hour presentation, executives fielded a question about how Tesla could grow its market share in China.

Elon Musk passed the question to Tom Zhu, who is heading up global production and has run the China and APAC businesses for Tesla for years. ‚ÄúAs long as you offer a product with value at affordable price you don‚Äôt have to worry about demand,‚Äù Zhu said. ‚ÄúWe try everything to cut costs,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúand pass down that value to our customers.‚Äù

Musk then added, ‚ÄúDemand is a function of affordability not desire.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúEven small changes in the price have a big effect on demand.‚Äù

Zhu also announced that as of Wednesday, Tesla had produced 4 million cars in total.

‚ÄúIt took us 12 years to build the first million, and about 18 months to the second million. The third million, 11 months. Then less than 7 months to build the 4 millionth,‚Äù Zhu said touting the company‚Äôs improving operational efficiency.

He said that the company plans to build new car and battery cell factories, and also to produce more cars per year at its existing factories.

Tesla charging leader Rebecca Tinucci said that in 2022 the company provided 9 terawatt hours across charging methods, including home charging including 40,000 Superchargers. (By way of comparison, the entire U.S. consumes about 4,000 terawatt hours of electricity per year.) Tinucci also noted that about half of the company‚Äôs Superchargers in the EU are open to other vehicles, and that the company just opened 10 Superchargers in the US to non-Teslas.

Tesla design leader Franz von Holzhausen and vice president of vehicle engineering Lars Moravy took the stage to show off a number of planned manufacturing changes meant to improve the efficiency of Tesla vehicle production. But von Holzhausen said that Tesla would not yet reveal its ‚Äúnext gen‚Äù vehicle.

The company‚Äôs powertrain vice president, Colin Campbell, said that Tesla‚Äôs next powertrain factory will be 50% smaller than the one in Austin, Texas, but will have the same capacity. He also said the company is working on a new kind of drive unit that is compatible with any battery cell type, and a motor that will be built without any rare earth metals.

Ahead of the 2023 Investor Day, at a press conference on Tuesday, Mexico president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Tesla had agreed to build a large factory in Monterrey, Mexico. He said Tesla agreed to use recycled water and take other initiatives to cope with water-scarcity in the region.

Musk confirmed the factory plans on Wednesday, and said production there would supplement, rather than replace, any manufacturing at other Tesla facilities.

Tesla shares have rebounded from declines during 2022, and are up more than 60% for the year so far. However, the stock dropped 1.43% on Wednesday prior to the event, and 5% after hours.

Mizuho Securities analysts maintained a buy rating on shares of Tesla ahead of Investor Day, seeing Tesla in a leadership position in a growing market for fully electric vehicles. They wrote in a note earlier this week, ‚ÄúNear-term, we see continued strength in TSLA‚Äôs market share, but see cheaper competitor EVs coming to market as potentially dilutive to TSLA‚Äôs share of the US EV market.‚Äù

Currently, the lowest-priced Tesla available is the Model 3 sedan, which starts at a price point of around $43,000, they wrote. Seven models from other automakers are currently priced below that, Mizhuo noted.

Musk‚Äôs ambitious Master Plan Part Deux was published in 2016, and has not been completely fulfilled. It included four main objectives:

‚ÄúCreate stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage‚Äù

‚ÄúExpand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments‚Äù

‚ÄúDevelop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning‚Äù

‚ÄúEnable your car to make money for you when you aren‚Äôt using it‚Äù.",Puginator,1125,1677727906.0

-Second round of cuts in four months driven by efficiency push

-Social networking giant may finalize plans in the next week

Meta Platforms Inc., the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is planning a fresh round of layoffs and will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.

The world‚Äôs largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13% reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organization. In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff. The company has also been working to flatten its organization, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalized and could affect thousands of staffers.

The imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the ‚Äúflattening,‚Äù said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.

This phase of layoffs could be finalized in the next week, according to the people. **Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.**

The November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta‚Äôs ‚Äúyear of efficiency,‚Äù and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.

Workers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they‚Äôd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said.

Far from being an AI victim, Google looks well positioned for whatever the future of AI may bring, and the lack of positive investor sentiment around this makes it even better to buy. You can buy Google here comfortably, and if the forward PE gets anywhere near where Meta's did, you can ramp up your purchases.

Google is not a recession-proof stock, they're not guaranteed to crush the competition in the AI space, and the company isn't yet as cheap as Meta was during their 2022 debacle. But Google is a great business for a good price.

A measure the Federal Reserve watches closely to gauge inflation rose more than expected in January, indicating the central bank has more work to do to bring down prices.

The personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy increased 0.6% for the month, and was up 4.7% from a year ago, the Commerce Department reported Friday. Wall Street had been expecting respective readings of 0.5% and 4.4%.

Including the volatile food and energy components, headline inflation increased 0.6% and 5.4% respectively.

Markets fell following the report, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average off more than 300 points.

Consumer spending also rose more than expected as prices increased, jumping 1.8% for the month vs. the estimate for 1.4%. Personal income increased 1.4%, higher than the 1.2% estimate. The personal saving rate also was up, rising to 4.7%.

All of the numbers suggest inflation accelerated to start the new year, putting the Fed in a position where it likely will continue to raise interest rates. The central bank has pushed benchmark rates up by 4.5 percentage points since March 2022 as inflation hit its highest level in some 41 years.

The Fed follows the PCE measures more closely than it does some of the other inflation metrics because the index adjusts for consumer spending habits, such as substituting lower-priced goods for more expensive ones. That provides a more accurate view of the cost of living.

Policymakers tend to focus more on core inflation as they believe it provides a better long-run view of inflation, though the Fed officially tracks headline PCE.

Much of January‚Äôs inflation surge came from a 2% rise in energy prices, according to Friday‚Äôs report. Food prices increased 0.4%. Goods and services both rose 0.6%.

On an annual basis, food prices rose 11.1%, while energy was up 9.6%.

Earlier Friday, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester noted in a CNBC interview that there has been some progress made but ‚Äúthe level of inflation is still too high.‚Äù

A nonvoting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, Mester has been pushing for more aggressive increases. She said she‚Äôs not sure if she‚Äôll again advocate for a half percentage point boost at the March FOMC meeting.

In the wake of Friday‚Äôs data, market pricing increased for the likelihood of a half-point, or 50 basis point, increase next month, to about 33%, according to CME Group data.",achzeet44,937,1677247806.0
stocks,11l1jod,Investors beware: Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments this week could spark a major tech sell-off,"[Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/investors-beware-fed-chair-jerome-powell-s-comments-this-week-could-spark-a-major-tech-sell-off-top-analyst-warns/ar-AA18i8Ag?ocid=hpmsn&cvid=b3053bf321d9497a8761bbdbbcab332f&ei=62)

After dropping more than 33% last year amid aggressive interest rate hikes and stubborn inflation, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite has recovered roughly 12% in 2023. Better than expected labor market data, the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and optimism about a potentially dovish Federal Reserve have helped boost the beaten down sector. But Gene Munster, a veteran tech analyst and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, warned Monday that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could pop tech investors‚Äô bubble this week. 

Fed Chair Powell will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday in his first public outing since a Feb. 7 interview with the private equity billionaire David Rubenstein that was largely interpreted as dovish by markets. He‚Äôs expected to discuss February‚Äôs Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes, where most Fed officials said they anticipated ‚Äúongoing‚Äù rate hikes and some even argued that recent labor market strength warrants a ‚Äútighter stance of monetary policy.‚Äù

Munster argued that Powell realized after his comments last month that if he is not ‚Äúoverly hawkish‚Äù‚Äîrepeatedly doubling down on his inflation-fighting stance‚Äîevery time he speaks, then markets interpret it as a sign that he will pause interest rate hikes or even pivot to cuts.

As a result, the tech analyst said that he expects to see Powell ‚Äúretreat to his fallback position of a more hawkish tone‚Äù during the hearing. And a hawkish Fed is never good for tech stocks, which rely on low rates to invest in their growth and are often valued using the Fed‚Äôs benchmark interest rate.",battle_rae,928,1678201149.0

stocks,118kalm,How to Read (and understand) the 4 Financial Statements:,"There are four financial statements that every investor should know:

* Balance Sheet
* Income Statement
* Cash Flow Statement
* Stockholders‚Äô Equity Statement

**Income Statement:**

The income statement, also known as the profit and loss statement, provides information about a company‚Äôs profitability and ability to generate income. It shows a company‚Äôs revenues, expenses, and net income over a specific period, making it an essential tool for investors to understand a company‚Äôs financial performance.

 The income statement is divided into two main sections: the income section and the expense section. The income section lists all the revenues that the company earned during the period, such as sales, interest income, and gains on investments. The expense section lists all the expenses that the company has incurred during the period. This includes the cost of goods sold, selling and administrative expenses, and interest expenses.

The net income (or loss) for the period is determined by subtracting expenses from revenues. This amount is then reported at the bottom of the income statement, along with any applicable taxes and the net income (or loss) per share of common stock.

When analyzing an income statement, there are three key items to look for:

1. Revenue growth: This shows whether a company‚Äôs revenue is increasing or decreasing over time, which can be a good indication of the company‚Äôs overall health and growth prospects
2. Profit margins: This refers to how much of the company‚Äôs revenue is being turned into profits. Higher profit margins are generally a positive sign, as they indicate that the company is managing its expenses
3. Expense management: This indicates whether a company is controlling its expenses. If a company‚Äôs expenses are rising faster than its revenues, it can be a red flag

**Balance Sheet:**

The balance sheet, also known as the statement of financial position, provides information about a company‚Äôs financial position, including its liquidity and solvency. It provides a snapshot of a company‚Äôs financial position at a specific point in time. It shows the company‚Äôs assets, liabilities, and equity, which helps investors understand the company‚Äôs net worth.

(1) Assets are resources that the company owns or controls and can include things like cash, accounts receivable, and property, plant, and equipment

(2) Liabilities are the debts and obligations that the company owes to others and can include things like accounts payable, taxes payable, and long-term debt

(3) Equity represents the ownership interests of the company‚Äôs shareholders. By subtracting the company‚Äôs liabilities from its assets, you can arrive at the company‚Äôs equity, which represents the value of the company‚Äôs ownership interests

When analyzing a balance sheet, there are three key items to look for:

1. Asset quality: This refers to whether the company‚Äôs asset base is strong and diverse. High-quality assets can help a company weather economic downturns and provide a solid foundation for growth
2. Debt levels: This shows whether the company is carrying a lot of debt. High levels of debt can increase a company‚Äôs financial risk and make it more vulnerable to economic downturns
3. Working capital: This reveals whether the company has enough resources to cover its short-term obligations. A company with strong working capital is generally considered to be more financially stable

**Cash Flows:**

The statement of cash flows shows how a company generates and uses cash. This helps to understand a company‚Äôs financial health and ability to meet its obligations. It presents the inflows and outflows of cash for a specific period of time and can be used to assess the company‚Äôs liquidity and solvency.

&#x200B;

 The statement of cash flows is divided into three sections:

1. Operating activities: This includes cash flows from a company‚Äôs core business operations, such as cash received from customers, cash paid to suppliers and employees, and other operating expenses
2. Investing activities: This includes the cash flows from the purchase and sale of long-term assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, as well as investments in other companies, such as through the purchase of stocks or bonds
3. Financing activities: This includes the cash flows from the issuance and repayment of a company‚Äôs debt and equity, such as the issuance of new shares of stock, the repayment of loans, and the payment of dividends to shareholders

To analyze a cash flow statement, look at the company‚Äôs operating cash flow, which represents the cash the company generates from its day-to-day operations. This provides a sense of the company‚Äôs underlying financial strength and ability to generate cash. An essential metric to evaluate is free cash flow, which is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow. Free cash flow represents the amount of cash a company has left over after investing in its business. This cash can be used to pay dividends, repay debt, or invest in new opportunities.

Pay close attention to the net change in cash and cash equivalents on a company‚Äôs statement of cash flows. This figure reflects the increase or decrease in the company‚Äôs cash and cash equivalents during the period. It can provide valuable insights into the company‚Äôs financial health and ability to meet its financial obligations and invest in future growth.

**Stockholders‚Äô Equity:**

The statement of stockholders‚Äô equity provides valuable insights into a company‚Äôs financial health and its ability to generate profits and distribute them to shareholders. It is important because it represents the portion of the company that belongs to shareholders. The statement is divided into two sections:

* The beginning balance shows total equity at the beginning of the period
* The changes during the period include all transactions that have occurred since the beginning of the period

 The statement of stockholders‚Äô equity includes the following items:

* Common stock: This is the amount of capital that has been contributed by the company‚Äôs shareholders in exchange for common stock
* Additional paid-in capital: The amount of capital that has been contributed by shareholders in excess of the par value of common stock
* Retained earnings: The amount of earnings the company has retained since its inception, after deducting dividends paid to shareholders
* Net income (or loss): This is the company‚Äôs net income (or loss) for the period, which is determined by subtracting the company‚Äôs expenses from its revenues
* Dividends: This is the amount of cash that the company has paid to its shareholders as dividends

To analyze stockholders‚Äô equity, compare the company‚Äôs equity to its assets to get a sense of the company‚Äôs financial leverage. High levels of debt can increase a company‚Äôs financial risk and make it more vulnerable to economic downturns. When analyzing stockholders‚Äô equity, it is important to look for two key things:

* Equity growth: Is the company‚Äôs equity increasing or decreasing over time? This can be a good sign of the company‚Äôs financial health and growth prospects
* Financial leverage: Is the company heavily reliant on debt financing? If so, this can increase the company‚Äôs financial risk and make it more vulnerable to economic downturns.",TonyLiberty,709,1677026734.0

stocks,11eemas,"TSLA plant in Monterrey, Mexico confirmed","Rumors have been circulating for at least a couple months, but confirmed now by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador: Tesla is set to build a brand new plant in Monterrey, Mexico. This is a huge boost for Mexico, as it's trying to establish itself as a hub for investment by bringing manufacturing capacity to North America and away from Asia, thanks to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lopez Obrador revealed that he had a call with Elon Musk on Monday, and they came to an agreement that will create lots of jobs and bring in a considerable investment. The President had previously expressed concerns over water shortages, but Musk was receptive and has accepted Mexico's proposals.

This investment is a big test for Mexico's President, who has a reputation for being a bit of a resource nationalist. Some companies have been unsettled by his efforts to strengthen state control of the energy market at the expense of private capital. But with Mexico receiving its highest foreign direct investment inflows for years in 2022, it's clear that the country's lower-cost and skilled workforce is making it a global center for the car industry.

We don't know all the details just yet, but Lopez Obrador said Tesla will likely give us more information tomorrow. It's all happening during Musk's ""Investor Day,"" where he'll outline his ""Master Plan Part Three.""

According to the report, younger consumers are concerned about being socially ostracised for not having an [iPhone](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/) ‚Äì a phenomenon that is driving young people to buy other Apple products and services, leading to growing market share across multiple product categories.

Those born after 1996, also known as Gen Z, compose 34 percent of all ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå owners in the U.S., compared to just 10 percent for Samsung. For older generations, there is a relatively even split between ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå and Android users. The ramifications of this shift toward Apple devices among younger people extends beyond iPhones, with these users being much more likely to purchase AirPods, Apple Watches, and Macs.

For every 100 iPhones Apple sells around the world, it also sells 26 iPads, 17 Apple Watches, and 35 pairs of AirPods, according to research by Canalys. For Samsung, every 100 smartphone sales leads to fewer than 11 tablets, six smartwatches, and six pairs of wireless earbuds being sold. This is in spite of the fact that the average selling price of an ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå is almost three times that of an Android device.

Researchers who advise companies about the preferences of Gen Z consumers told the *Financial Times* that these customers are the most online of any age group, spending up to six hours a day on their smartphones. As a result, Apple's ecosystem is shaping social decision-making, with particular emphasis on the importance of iMessage as a social signal, necessitated by inferior experiences messaging and using group chats via SMS.

In Europe, where iMessage is less prevalent and Android has a bigger market share, the same trend is similarly visible. Canalys research indicates that 83 percent of Apple users in western Europe under 25 years old plan to keep using an ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå. As Gen Z gets older, this trend is likely to grow and further entrench Apple's market share, making it increasingly difficult for rival companies to capture new customers and make inroads.",PizzaMan11554,617,1677026804.0

Charlie Munger said Wednesday that Tesla pales in comparison to BYD in China, calling the Chinese electric vehicle maker his favorite stock ever.

‚ÄúI have never helped do anything at Berkshire [Hathaway] that was as good as BYD and I only did it once,‚Äù the 99-year-old investor said at the Daily Journal‚Äôs virtual annual meeting Wednesday. Berkshire initial investment is now ‚Äúworth about $8 billion or maybe $9 [billion]. That‚Äôs a pretty good rate of return,‚Äù said Warren Buffett‚Äôs longtime investment partner.

BYD has been a lucrative bet for Berkshire , which first bought about 220 million shares in September 2008. The stock has jumped more than 600% in the past 10 years amid the massive growth in electric vehicles. Berkshire has actually been trimming its BYD stake in the past year as the stock has become increasingly pricey.

‚ÄúAt the current price of BYD stock, little BYD is worth more than the entire Mercedes corporation. It‚Äôs not a cheap stock, but on the other hand, it‚Äôs a very remarkable company,‚Äù Munger said.

Munger, Berkshire‚Äôs vice chairman and a Daily Journal board member, credited Li Lu, founder of Seattle-based asset manager Himalaya Capital, for introducing him to BYD. Munger also said BYD CEO Wang Chuanfu is unusual, calling him a genius and a workaholic.

Asked if he would prefer Tesla or BYD as an investment, Munger said the answer is easy.

‚ÄúTesla last year reduced its prices in China twice. BYD increased its prices. We are direct competitors. BYD is so much ahead of Tesla in China ... it‚Äôs almost ridiculous,‚Äù Munger said.

BYD recently said it expects record adjusted annual profit for 2022 of 16.3 billion yuan ($2.4 billion), about 1,200% above 2021.

‚ÄúBYD last year made more than $2 billion after taxes in the auto business in China. It‚Äôs incredible what‚Äôs happened,‚Äù Munger said. ‚ÄúIf you count all the manufacturing space they have in China to make cars, it would amount to a big percentage of the Manhattan island, and nobody had ever heard of them a few years ago.‚Äù

The longtime investor called Tesla CEO Elon Musk talented ‚Äî and peculiar. He previously said what Musk achieved in the car business was a ‚Äúminor miracle.‚Äù

stocks,1181ykz,"Home Depot misses on revenue, issues muted outlook","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/home-depot-hd-q4-earnings-2022.html

Home Depot‚Äôs revenue fell short of Wall Street‚Äôs estimates in its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report Tuesday.

The company also provided a muted outlook for the next year amid a tough consumer backdrop.

Here‚Äôs what the company posted, compared to what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $3.30 vs. $3.28 expected
Revenue: $35.83 billion vs. $35.97 billion expected
It‚Äôs the first time Home Depot missed Wall Street‚Äôs revenue expectations since November 2019, before the Covid pandemic. Shares of the company fell 4% in pre-market trading.

In the quarter ended Jan. 29, Home Depot reported $35.83 billion in sales, up 0.3% from the year ago period, which saw $35.72 billion in revenue. The retailer‚Äôs reported net income of $3.36 billion was also 0.3% higher than the year ago period, which was $3.35 billion, or $3.21 per share.

Amid record levels of inflation, a shift in consumer behavior and a housing market slowdown, the home improvement retailer has repeatedly beat the Street‚Äôs expectations over the last year but fell a bit short in sales estimates.

The company attributed that solely to a drop in lumber costs, which had surged in price due to nationwide shortages in fiscal 2021. The drop in lumber negatively impacted comparable sales by 0.7%, the company said. 

‚ÄúBut for that we would have been right in line with our expectations,‚Äù Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail told CNBC.

‚ÄúAfter two years of high volatility, we‚Äôve seen a little more stability in recent weeks and months, but it‚Äôs hard to predict lumber prices.‚Äù

Home Depot said it expects sales and comparable sales to be approximately flat for the new fiscal year. They project an operating margin rate of about 14.5%, which is impacted by a $1 billion investment Home Depot is making in wage growth. 

Home Depot expects a mid-single digit percent decline in diluted earnings-per-share.

The retailer issued the muted outlook because it expects some pressure in the goods sector and flat consumer spending, McPhail said.

‚ÄúSo we work from kind of a fundamental assumption that consumer spending will be flat. We know that our market has seen a gradual shift that reflects the broader shift in the economy, in consumer spending from goods to services,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúDuring Covid, we saw a shift into goods. Over the last really almost two years, we‚Äôve seen a gradual shift back away from goods into services and we think our market has reflected that and we think that that dynamic could put some pressure on our market.‚Äù

These days, shoppers are using their discretionary dollars towards experiences and travel as many burn through their savings amid consistent inflation.

Still, McPhail insisted investments the company has made positions them to ‚Äútake share in any environment‚Äù and they‚Äôre confident they‚Äôll overcome any market pressures.

Total customer transactions dropped 6% in the quarter compared to the year ago period but the average ticket cost ‚Äì $90.05 ‚Äì was up 5.8%.

‚ÄúAfter a year of defying gravity, the slowing economy and pressures on consumers have finally caught up with Home Depot,‚Äù Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData, said in a statement.

‚ÄúTo be fair, the final quarter results are not terrible ‚Äì especially as they come off the back of a long period of extremely good growth ‚Äì but they nevertheless represent a material slowdown and are the worst quarterly performance in two years.‚Äù

Saunders said Home Depot‚Äôs earnings reflect a slowdown in the housing market, which is a key driver of spend for the home improvement sector.

‚ÄúUnfortunately for Home Depot, the dip in the housing market also coincided with a fall in the number of people undertaking DIY,‚Äù said Saunders.

‚ÄúOur data show that the number of improvement projects done by consumers fell over the prior year as people conserved cash for other activities over the holiday period.‚Äù

Still, despite a relatively stagnant housing market following a red-hot 2021, the retailer thinks high mortgage rates could prove beneficial for its results.

‚ÄúAs mortgage rates increase, we see a kind of an interesting dynamic in homeowners who are happy with their fixed rate mortgage and then decided to improve in place,‚Äù said McPhail.

‚ÄúYou just don‚Äôt have very many willing sellers in the market today... that is driving the tendency to improve in place.‚Äù

Overall, the company saw $157.4 billion in sales in fiscal 2022, up 4.1% from fiscal 2021, and $17.1 billion in profits, a small jump from the $16.4 billion reported last year.",Puginator,561,1676981361.0

Tesla said Thursday it‚Äôs recalling ‚Äúcertain 2016-2023 Model S, Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving Beta (FSD Beta) software or pending installation.‚Äù The recall includes 362,758 vehicles.

The FSD Beta system may cause crashes by allowing the affected vehicles to: ‚Äúact unsafe around intersections, such as traveling straight through an intersection while in a turn-only lane, entering a stop sign-controlled intersection without coming to a complete stop, or proceeding into an intersection during a steady yellow traffic signal without due caution,‚Äù according to the notice on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

The FSD Beta system may also have trouble responding appropriately ‚Äúto changes in posted speed limits,‚Äù the notice said.

The group of affected vehicles included the following years and models: 2016-2023 Model S and Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with or pending installation of FSD Beta.

Tesla lets thousands of drivers try new and unfinished driver assistance features on public roads in the U.S. through FSD Beta. The technology does not make Tesla electric cars autonomous, nor safe to drive without a human at the wheel ready to brake or steer at any second ‚Äî despite the brand name.

Only Tesla owners who have the company‚Äôs premium FSD driver assistance system installed in their cars can join the FSD Beta program. That option now costs $15,000 up front or $199 per month in the U.S. today. Owners must obtain a high driver-safety score, as determined by Tesla software that monitors their driving habits, and maintain it to get FSD Beta access.

FSD Beta can best be summarized as a host of new features that are not yet fully debugged. The main attraction is ‚Äúautosteer on city streets,‚Äù which lets a Tesla navigate around complex urban environments automatically, if imperfectly.",Puginator,554,1676571941.0

The WSJ article focuses among consumers with the worst credit scores.

## Data about credit scores:

- [Distribution of credit scores](https://i.imgur.com/OXAcVNj.png) as of April 2022, from a [CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/19/how-to-get-your-credit-score-above-800.html) in January 2023 (please share updated data if you can find it). The WSJ article defines subprime as sub 660, which is roughly around 25-30% of US consumers with credit scores.
- Average credit score is around 710 currently ([Business Insider in October 2022 citing Experian data from 2021](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/average-credit-score)). It was 687 in 2010. [Here is a table for all ages, using 2021 data](https://i.imgur.com/YDiojl8.png). Minnesota has the highest average at 742, while Mississippi averages 681.

## Auto loan data:

- [Graph of share of 30 days or more delinquent *subprime* (sub 660) *auto* debt](https://i.imgur.com/HHYsgQx.png)
- [Graph of share of 30 days or more delinquent *subprime* (sub 660) *auto* debt, broken down by credit score](https://i.imgur.com/io1LliF.png). The trend for those sub 660 is pretty unremarkable, and it is those sub 580 credit score really seeing a big uptick. This is the bottom 15% roughly of US consumers with credit scores (see first graph).
- What about across *all* credit scores? Well the share *auto* delinquent more than *90 days* is 3.73% [as of Q4 2022](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_auto_loans_delinquent_by_90_days); more than *60 days* is 1.84% ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/04/auto-loan-delinquencies-rise-what-to-do-if-you-struggle-with-payments.html) on Feb 4). I couldn't find the most recent 30 day or more auto delinquency rate but from Ally Bank it appears to be around 2-3%. Beware of some fear-mongering when you hear statistics like 'delinquencies rose 30%' because often it's a move from say 2% to 2.6%; the level is already very low so the percentage change is not very meaningful.
- The subprime (< 660 credit score) *auto* delinquency rate for 30 days or more debt is 9.3%
- [Student loan debt and auto debt](https://i.imgur.com/9SakTFo.png) is a relatively small portion of overall household debt. It's still mostly mortgage debt like it has always been. So this is not going to trigger a 2008 meltdown on its own.

> # More Auto Payments Are Late, Exposing Cracks in Consumer Credit
> 
> ## Borrowers with low credit scores fall behind in numbers unseen since 2010
> 
> The U.S. economy is on a steady footing and the unemployment rate is superlow. Yet a rising number of Americans are falling behind on their car payments. 
> 
> Some **9.3% of auto loans** extended to people with **low credit scores** were **30 or more days behind on payments at the end of last year**, the **highest share since 2010**, according to an analysis by Moody‚Äôs Analytics.
> 
> The past few years have been unusually good for consumers, who stowed away extra money during the pandemic, but sky-high inflation is eating away at those gains. Car prices, in particular, jumped because of a shortage of vehicles. Many borrowers took out large loans to buy them, leaving little breathing room to keep up with payments if they hit a rough patch.
> 
> ‚ÄúThe households that were on the financial ledge to begin with might have been tipped to the point where it‚Äôs hard to keep up on the car loan and everything else, and people have to make some very hard decisions,‚Äù said Pamela Foohey, a professor at Cardozo School of Law who studies consumer law.
> 
> Stress in the auto-loan market is **concentrated among borrowers with credit scores below 660** and is especially high among people with bottom of the barrel credit. But the stress could spread if the U.S. goes into a recession, as many economists expect. If job losses increase, many more consumers might find themselves unable to keep up with the record amounts of debt they took out in recent years.
> 
> 
> [...] Borrowers who took out big loans at the height of the boom owe far more than their vehicles are worth. Those buyers are sticking lenders with bigger losses when they fall behind.
> 
> Ally Financial Inc., which operates a large auto-lending business, said in January that the **loans it extended between mid-2021 and mid-2022 are experiencing bigger early losses than its other loans**. In the **fourth quarter, the percentage of its car loans that were more than 60 days past due rose above prepandemic levels for the first time**.
> 
> Car prices peaked when borrowers‚Äô financial profiles looked especially strong. Consumers had received government stimulus and cut back on spending early in the pandemic, which padded their savings. Then stock prices surged, and a booming economy helped people land hefty raises.
> 
> Consumers‚Äô credit scores rose, which might have made underwriting less precise, according to Ryan Nash, an analyst at Goldman Sachs who covers banks. Lenders were able to make big loans to borrowers, sometimes on the assumption that their finances had strengthened permanently. 
> 
> ‚Äú2021 was a bit of the Wild West in the auto market,‚Äù Mr. Nash said. 
> 
> Nearly **a fifth of banks said they eased credit standards for auto-loan applicants in the first half of 202**1, according to a Federal Reserve survey of senior loan officers, while more than **a 10th did in the second half.** Many said they lowered minimum credit score requirements that year. 
> 
> Consumer lawyers said that when cars were in short supply during that time, some dealers were able to sell vehicles that were in worse condition, increasing the risk that they would break down or require major repairs. A key reason borrowers stop paying is that the car stops working.
> 
> ‚ÄúWe get a tremendous number of calls from people who bought cars that never should have been put on the road,‚Äù said Daniel Blinn, a Connecticut-based attorney who has sued dealerships and auto lenders.
> 
> The number of **people losing their cars to repossession rose 11% in 2022** but remains **below prepandemic levels**, according to estimates by Cox Automotive based on wholesale auctions and default rates.

WWE is in talks with state gambling regulators in Colorado and Michigan to legalize betting on high-profile matches, according to people familiar with the matter.

WWE is working with the accounting firm EY to secure scripted match results in hopes it will convince regulators there‚Äôs no chance of results leaking to the public, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Accounting firms PwC and EY, also known as Ernst & Young, have historically worked with award shows, including the Academy Awards and the Emmys, to keep results a secret.

Betting on the Academy Awards is already legal and available through some sports betting applications, including market leaders FanDuel and DraftKings, although most states don‚Äôt allow it. WWE executives have cited Oscars betting as a template to convince regulators gambling on scripted matches is safe, the people said.

Still, while Academy Awards voting results are known by a select few before they‚Äôre announced publicly, they aren‚Äôt scripted by writers. Even if regulators allow gambling, betting companies would have to decide if they‚Äôre willing to place odds on WWE matches even if it‚Äôs legalized.

Shares DraftKings surged Friday morning after the sports-betting company reported stronger-than-expected revenue and raised its outlook for 2023.

The bump in stock comes on the heels of DraftKings being the most downloaded sportsbook app in the U.S. on Super Bowl Sunday, according to the company. States where sports betting is newly legal are boosting sales, too.

For its fiscal fourth quarter, Draftkings said its revenue of $855 million is an increase of 81% compared to the $473 million it took in during the same period in 2021. It reported a loss of 53 cents per share on revenue of $855 million. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had anticipated a loss of 59 cents per share on revenue of $800 million.

The company attributed the results to continued customer retention, acquisition and engagement in existing states, as well as successful launches of its Sportsbook and iGaming products in additional jurisdictions.

stocks,110pvcm,Carvana stock analysis and valuation - On a highway to bankruptcy?,"This post is a summary of my analysis of Carvana. I hope you enjoy reading it and feel free to add your take and agree/disagree with what's mentioned below.

***Disclaimer: I do not own any shares of Carvana and have no intentions of opening a position.***

The post covers the following:

1. Introduction & Fundamental analysis of the business.
2. Historical financial performance
3. The balance sheet (and the liquidity challenge)
4. The useless ""key operating metrics""
5. Assumptions & valuation
6. Valuation based on assumptions different than mine

**Introduction**

Carvana is a company referred to as ""The Amazon of cars"" (Is it going to live up to that expectation, we're yet to see) and is an eCommerce platform for buying/selling used cars.

This is known as a fairly low-margin business, but the companies in this industry also engage in selling financing loans (as they are the first to make any such offers to potential customers) as well as earn various commissions (such as insurance). This part has a gross margin of 100% as, well, there's no cost to it.

Unlike the traditional competitors in this industry, Carvana has no brick-and-mortar stores, but it does have over 30 vending machines. This model allows them to have lower variable costs, increase scalability and also build brand awareness as such vending machines definitely stand out.

Their business model can be outlined through the lenses of a vehicle lifecycle:

1. Vehicle Acquisition
2. (In-house) inspection and reconditioning
3. Photography and merchandising
4. Transportation and fulfillment (as early as the next day)

Carvana is public since April 2017 and the IPO price was $15/share. On the first trading day, roughly one-third of the valuation was gone. However, by mid-August 2021, the share price was over $360, representing a return of over 30x. Today, the share price is close to $11 (down 97% from the peak). We will come back to this share price movement later in the post.

&#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

The company's revenue grew incredibly fast, from $2b back in 2018 to $14b for the LTM (""last twelve months"") ending September 30th, 2022. This was fueled not only by Covid-19 (When the traditional brick-and-mortar competitors had to close their stores) but also by the increase in the prices of used cars.

Their gross margin went from 10% in 2018 to 15% in 2021 and is now down to 11% for LTM.

However, that percentage isn't sufficient (yet) to cover their SG&A expenses, which decreased from 22% of revenue back in 2018 to 19% for the LTM.

This means Carvana is yet to reach profitability and its operating margin is -8%.

This can be translated to per-vehicle calculation.

|Vehicles sold|94,108|177,549|244,111|425,237|438,635|

&#x200B;

The management is targeting a 15-19% gross margin in the long run and an operating profit between 7.5% and 13%. How realistic is this? There is only 1 competitor that has an operating margin within that range, and that is AutoNation (8% operating margin), so I'll let you be the judge of that.

All the other competitors have either lower operating margins (most often below 5%) or are unprofitable.

&#x200B;

**The balance sheet (and the liquidity challenge)**

Up until this point, it seems like a story of a growth company that is trying to figure out its way to profitability. However, the balance sheet shows a different side of this journey.

Although this is a money-losing company, with losses of $1.2b for the LTM, for some reason, its cash balance has always been fairly low. As of September 30th, 2022, Carvana had **$316m of cash.**

Other than the inventory of $2.6b (roughly 90k vehicles), it is important to note that they acquired Adesa, a physical auction business, with 56 sites that can be used for storage, photography, and reconditioning of vehicles. Overall, this seems like an acquisition that fits well within the business.

Here's the big problem, the company has **A LOT of debt** and I mean **A LOT**! Here's how it evolved over the last 5 years:

&#x200B;

|2018|2019|2020|2021|Sept. 2022|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$633|$1,630|$1,890|$5,803|$8,073|

The last increase was to fund the acquisition of Adesa and since they are quite leveraged, the interest rate was 10.25%! 

In the last quarter that they reported, the interest expense was $153m!

So, here's an unprofitable company, losing over $1b from its operations in a year, with a very low cash balance and a huge debt burden. On top of that, they borrow more, to make an acquisition.

Now, one of the main questions is, how can they survive?

A lot of additional funding is required, likely $3-4 billion until they break even.

The challenge is, how can they get this funding? In theory, there are two main ways:

1. **Issue more shares** \- This would be difficult as their share price has dropped significantly and their entire market cap is now $2b. In hindsight, it is strange that the management did not issue shares when the share price was $360+, knowing that the company will be unprofitable for quite a while.
2. **Get more debt** \- This is also difficult as the interest rates offered to them are double-digit.

The management has two priorities, reduce expenses significantly and become free cash flow positive.

&#x200B;

**The useless ""key operating metrics""**

In one part of the public reports, there are the so-called ""key operating metrics"", which I find useless, but you can disagree with me. Here they are (as well as my comment in brackets):

**- Retail units sold** \- This is irrelevant unless these vehicles are sold to generate a net profit.

**- Population coverage** \- Unless people are making purchases that create value for Carvana's shareholders, this is also irrelevant.

**- Average monthly unique visitors (in thousands)** \- This reminds me of everything I've heard about the dot-com bubble. Bragging about numbers that do not translate into cash flow.

**- Total website units** \- Same as the first point, it doesn't matter if there are 50k vehicles listed or 80k. None of that is a proxy for how well the company is doing and whether these vehicles are sold at a profit or not.

**- Total gross profit per unit** \- This one was quite close to being a good operating metric, but they decided to use gross profit instead of net profit per unit.

&#x200B;

**Assumptions & valuation**

In order to make a valuation, we need to assume that Carvana will actually go through this period and secure additional funding. Otherwise, there's no valuation to be done as the company is on its way to bankruptcy.

So, here are my assumptions:

**Revenue growth:**  10% in year 1, then 5% for the next 4 years, then down to 2% **(this is translated to 51% revenue growth in 10 years)**

**Operating margin:** 7.5% by year 10 (-5% in year 1, -3% in year 2, break-even in year 3, 2% in year 4, etc.) - the low end of the management's long-term target. This might also be a stretch but stay with me for now.

**Discount rate (WACC-based):** 8.8% (Cost of equity of almost 20%, and after-tax cost of debt of roughly 6%) --> reducing over time to 7.7% (close to having a beta of 1) - Yes, I know, this might also be a stretch, but look at the outcome, even under these assumptions

**Outcome (in millions):**

|PV of CFs over the next 10 years|\-$172|
|:-|:-|
|PV of terminal value|$7,951|
|**Value of the business**|7,779|
|\+ Cash|$316|
|\+ Other non-operating assets|$835|
|\- Debt|$8,073|
|\- Value of equity options|$100|
|**Value of equity**|**$757**|
|\# of shares|189|
|**Value per share**|**$4.01**|

Based on the assumptions above, the outcome is roughly $4/share, leading to the conclusion that Carvana is overvalued.

&#x200B;

**Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**

&#x200B;

Of course, I could be significantly wrong in my assumptions. The table below shows how the valuation changes (per share), based on assumptions regarding the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin.

&#x200B;

|Revenue / Op. margin|5%|7.5%|10%|12.5%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|40% ($19.7b)|\-$15.7|$2.6|$19.6|$37.5|
|51% ($21.1b)|\-$15.6|$4.0|$22.3|$41.6|
|75% ($24.6b)|\-$15.6|$9.0|$32.2|$56.5|
|100% ($28.1b)|\-$15.3|$10.5|$34.8|$60.4|

Unless Carvana can deliver an operating margin of 7.5% or more, the company is worthless (based on the assumptions above). However, if it can deliver an operating margin of 10%+, then it's undervalued. In any case, there's no justification for the price at the $360/share level, other than fear of missing out.

""Buy low and sell high"" is a common adage, but it seems to escape most investors. Data indicates that, on average, equity investors fall short of the market's performance by 400-600 bps each year.

Attempting to anticipate the market's movements is advisable when stocks become significantly mispriced. 

Is it advisable to attempt market timing at present? 

Currently, the Federal Reserve is endeavouring to put the brakes on the economy's growth and has swiftly increased cash rates to achieve this. Opting to invest in cash to achieve returns comparable to those of high-risk investments is a logical move. It is plausible that cash rates may ascend to 6% and remain there for over a year to curb inflation.

Salesforce shares soared 13% in extended trading on Wednesday after the cloud software maker beat Wall Street estimates on profit and issued a better-than-expected forecast.

Here‚Äôs how the company did:

Earnings: $1.68 per share, adjusted, vs. $1.36 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue: $8.38 billion, vs. $7.99 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Salesforce‚Äôs revenue grew 14% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Jan. 31, according to a statement. The company reported a loss of $98 million, compared with a loss of $28 million in the year-ago quarter.

Profitability has become a higher priority at Salesforce, which in recent months has been getting pressured by an influx of activist investors, including Third Point, Elliott Management and Starboard Value. The company announced the addition of ValueAct Capital CEO Mason Morfit to its board.

In January Marc Benioff, Salesforce‚Äôs co-founder and CEO, said the company would cut 10% of its workforce, representing over 7,000 people. At the end of the quarter Bret Taylor, who ran Salesforce as co-CEO alongside Benioff, stepped down.

For the fiscal first quarter, the company called for adjusted earnings in the range of $1.60 to $1.61 per share and revenue of $8.16 billion to $8.18 billion. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had been looking for $1.32 in adjusted earnings per share and $8.05 billion in revenue.

Salesforce sees adjusted earnings per share for the full year of $7.12 to $7.14 and revenue of $34.5 billion to $34.7 billion. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected $5.84 in adjusted earnings per share and $34.03 billion in revenue.

Salesforce shares have risen 26% so far this year, excluding Wednesday‚Äôs after-hours move, outperforming the S&P 500 index, which has gained 3% over the same period.",Puginator,392,1677705577.0
stocks,119wjcn,Alibaba shares rally 6% after massive earnings beat,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/alibaba-shares-rally-4percent-after-massive-earnings-beat.html

Alibaba reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter that smashed expectations, sending U.S.-listed shares soaring 4% higher.

Here‚Äôs how Alibaba did in its fiscal third quarter, which ran from October to December 2022, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates: 

Revenue: 247.76 billion Chinese yuan vs 245.18 billion Chinese yuan expected, up 2% year-on-year

Earnings per American depositary share (ADS): 19.26 yuan vs 16.26 yuan expected, up 14% year-on-year.

Net income: 46.82 billion yuan vs 34.02 billion yuan, up 69% year-on-year.

Around $600 billion has been wiped off the value of Alibaba since its peak in October 2020, as a tightening regulatory environment on tech firms in China along with China‚Äôs strict Covid-19 control policies, and subsequent economic slowdown, hit the e-commerce giant.

Alibaba shares in Hong Kong on Thursday closed higher ahead of earnings, as investors bet that that China‚Äôs economic re-opening will help boost consumer sentiment and spending, which will ultimately help the e-commerce giant. During the December quarter, China abruptly ended its strict Covid controls such as lockdowns. However, this is not likely to be fully reflected in the quarter as it took place in December.

Revenue from Alibaba‚Äôs biggest business, the China commerce division, which includes its popular marketplace Taobao, totaled 169.99 billion yuan, down by 1% year-on-year. The drop was driven by a 9% year-on-year decline in customer management revenue, obtained from services such as marketing that Alibaba sells to merchants on its Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms.

Alibaba said that gross merchandise volume ‚Äî or the value of transactions across the company‚Äôs online shopping platforms ‚Äî ‚Äúdeclined mid-single-digit year-over-year, mainly due to soft consumption demand and ongoing competition as well as a surge in COVID-19 cases in China that resulted in supply chain and logistics disruptions in December.‚Äù

The company said that it sees a rebound in China‚Äôs economy and consumption.

‚ÄúLooking ahead, we expect continued recovery in consumer sentiment and economic activity,‚Äù Daniel Zhange, CEO of Alibaba, said in a press release.

Amid a slowdown in its China activity, Alibaba has sought growth in overseas markets through its South East Asia business Lazada and through global e-commerce site AliExpress. International commerce revenue grew 18% year-on-year to 19.47 billion Chinese yuan.

Analysts are expecting Alibaba to see faster revenue growth over the coming quarters as the full effect of the Chinese economic re-opening is felt. Morgan Stanley named Alibaba its ‚Äútop pick‚Äù in the Chinese tech sector for the first time in three years, in a recent note.

Last year, Alibaba embarked on measures to control costs in order to improve profitability. The company is trying to find a balance between costs and continuing to make important investments for long-term growth.

Those efforts are paying off with the 69% year-on-year jump in net income. The company‚Äôs operating margin stood at 14% in the December quarter, higher than the 3% reported in the same period of last year.

Alibaba managed to reduce losses across all of its business in the December quarter, including in its logistics arm Cainiao and its cloud division.

‚ÄúDuring the past quarter, we continued to improve operating efficiency and cost optimization that resulted in robust profit growth,‚Äù Toby Xu, chief financial officer of Alibaba, said in a press release.

Meanwhile, the regulatory tightening that took place over the past two years is beginning to ease, as enforcement of regulation becomes more predictable.

The company is also trying to boost the confidence of shareholders amid its stock slump. In November, Alibaba said its board has approved an additional $15 billion as part of its existing $25 billion share buyback program which will be extended to the end of its 2025 fiscal year.

Alibaba is also in the process of making Hong Kong a ‚Äúprimary‚Äù listing for its shares, paving the way for mainland China investors to trade the stock directly. However, the company said in November that the process would not be completed in 2022 as it had initially been planned.",Puginator,379,1677155362.0

Shares of Airbnb rose about 11% in extended trading Tuesday after the company released fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts‚Äô estimates on top and bottom lines.

Here‚Äôs how the company did:


EPS: 48 cents vs. 25 cents expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.


Revenue: $1.90 billion vs. $1.86 billion expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue for the fourth quarter was up 24% year over year. Airbnb reported $319 million in net income for the quarter, up from $55 million a year earlier, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of $506 million, surpassing the $432 million expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

In its shareholder letter, Airbnb said it‚Äôs seeing continued strong demand at the start of 2023. The company said revenue in first quarter will be between $1.75 billion and $1.82 billion, above the $1.69 billion expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv.

Airbnb said it made difficult choices to cut spending during the pandemic but has modestly increased its headcount over the past two years. The company said it expects to ‚Äúcontinue hiring at a judicious pace in 2023,‚Äù and that, compared to 2019, its headcount is down 5% while revenue is up 75%.

Gross booking value, which Airbnb uses to track host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $13.5 billion in the fourth quarter. The company reported 88.2 million nights and experiences booked in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year, but below the 89.7 million expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

Airbnb said in the investor letter that travelers are returning to major cities, which has historically been one of the ‚Äústrongest areas‚Äù of its business. The company said domestic and short-distance travel continued to be strong, but it saw ‚Äúeven further improvement‚Äù in longer-distance and cross-border travel during the quarter.

Airbnb said guest demand and supply growth remained strong throughout 2022.

Average daily rates decreased by 1% from a year ago to $153 in the fourth quarter. The company ended 2022 with 6.6 million active listings, which reflects an increase of over 900,000, or 16%, compared to 2021.

stocks,11j6yp7,5 Most Common Investing Mistakes (and my safeguards),"I went through a lot of surveys on investing mistakes and compiled a list of the 5 most common ones. My input in this is the safeguards that I have in place that help me avoid these mistakes.

As human beings, we're facing all kinds of risks in our lives. Often times we have certain safeguards in place, whether that is conscious or not.

Think of the time you were taught that before passing on the other side of a street, you need to take a look left and right (or right and left, depending on the country you live in). If we dissect this simple event, the risk comes from all the vehicles on the street and the safeguard is taking a look to make sure it is safe.

Now, in the world of investing, there are plenty of risks, but not that many articles when it comes to safeguards. I hope that this post is helpful to some, so let's dive right into the 5 most common mistakes:

# Mistake #1 Listening to others

Buying or selling stocks based on someone's opinion is oftentimes a bad idea. Today, there's an overload of information and it comes in various forms (Reddit posts, Tweets, YouTube videos, news articles, etc.). Many times, these are written in such a way that they sound convincing as if it is a great opportunity. In some cases, the average reader/viewer acts upon them. Of course, not all of these opinions are bad, but acting on each and everyone is generally a proven recipe to lose money. 

This is why there are plenty of posts **""Hey, I have X number of shares in company Y. The stock price is down 20% since I invested, should I hold the shares or should I sell?""** \- Every time I see a post such as this one, it is quite clear that that person doesn't know the value of the holding. This is the outcome of buying shares because of someone else's opinion. The solution is definitely not asking again for the next action.

**Safeguard: Do your own due diligence**

This can be time-consuming, but it works for me. I often times stumble upon articles/posts/videos that seem very convincing and contain a solid investment thesis. But I am aware that the person behind the information could've missed something important. So, I note down the ticker, and sometime in the future, I analyze the company myself, without bringing any bias in the process.

&#x200B;

# Mistake #2 Trying to time the market

""I'll invest after the market crash and then I'll sell on the top"" - This sounds amazing, doesn't it? The problem is that there is no successful long-term investor who timed the market over a long period of time.

Here's a title of an article written back on March 28th, 2016: 'Rich Dad' author says the 2016 market collapse he foresaw in 2002 is coming.

Oh, where do I start? Robert Kiyosaki, in 2002, foresaw a market collapse in 2016 (that never happened). He continued banging on the same door, about the market crash being here and eventually, he was right, it happened in 2022! However, the S&P500 was up 100% since this article. So anyone who ""waited"", well, that turns out to be a terrible decision. For every market crash that someone predicted, there are 10 others that the same person predicted, but never happened.

Now, let me be clear, I have no respect for this type of individuals that make money by selling content (articles, videos) that are based on fear (""OMG THE WORLD IS CRASHING!"") or the complete opposite (""THIS STOCK WILL 10X IN 2 YEARS!""). But we are surrounded by such content and it is important to acknowledge that none of these individuals have a magic ball.

**Safeguard: Ignore such information**

&#x200B;

# Mistake #3 Overestimating the future growth and/or profitability

If there's a mistake that I'm most guilty of, it is this one. It happens mostly when someone is looking at a company and imagines a bright future. However, being too optimistic means assuming higher growth/profitability that the company eventually delivers. These high and unreasonable assumptions I put in the category of ""wishful thinking"".

**Safeguard: Apply margin of safety**

I'll best illustrate this through an example. I valued Tesla at $190/share. The average cost per share of Tesla in my portfolio is $150/share. I know that I could be wrong in my assumptions, so I waited for a better entry point.

&#x200B;

# Mistake #4 Confirmation bias

This seems to exist most when someone:

\- Owns shares in a certain company

\- Has emotions about the position in that particular company

\- Really wants to be right that it is a good investment

The outcome in some cases is confirmation bias. Basically, trying to find information that confirms the thesis and ignores the ones that don't.

**Safeguard: Don't be arrogant, nobody knows everything. Businesses change over time, so adjust the assumptions accordingly**

When presented with a new piece of information, it is important to be objective and assess the impact it has on the fundamentals of a certain business and incorporate it in the valuation. If that new piece of information changes the investment decision from buy to sell, so be it.

# Mistake #5 Failing to monitor the investments

This is the easiest mistake to make, but also the easiest to prevent. Companies change, there are decisions being made fairly often and some of them have an impact on (part of) the business. To make sure you're up to date and have the most recent information, there's a simple safeguard.

**Safeguard: Read the public information coming from the company directly**

The last 4 words of the safeguard are important. Otherwise, it's mistake #1 all over again and the focus is not on facts, but on speculation.

It looks like these companies are starting to try to move into each other's territory.

Lender SVB Financial Group‚Äôs stock plummeted Thursday as it sold securities to realign its portfolio in response to higher interest rates while it manages lower deposit levels from clients who continue to spend cash. 

 The stock (ticker: SIVB ) fell 41.9%¬†to $155.72 by late morning on Thursday. The decline, the steepest among companies in the S&P 500 , put the shares on pace for their largest percentage decrease since¬†Sept. 10, 1998, when they fell 42.3%,

Analysts shared Neutral ratings on the stock.

On Wednesday after the market closed, SVB said it sold all of its $21 billion in securities classified as available for sale, a portfolio essentially comprised of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. It said it suffered an after-tax loss of $1.8 billion, to be recorded in the first quarter of 2023, as a result. Prices of fixed-income securities such as MBS and Treasury debt fall as interest rates go up.

 The company plans to reinvest the proceeds from the sale into shorter-term debt to take advantage of rising rates.

‚ÄúThe sale of substantially all of our AFS securities will enable us to increase our asset sensitivity, partially lock in funding costs, better insulate net interest income (NII) and net interest margin (NIM) from the impact of higher interest rates, and enhance profitability,‚Äù SVB said.

SVB is also raising $2.25 billion, including $500 million from private-equity firm General Atlantic and by offering $1.25 billion of convertible and common stock to investors.

SVB, parent of Silicon Valley Bank, enjoyed a bull run in 2021 as it lent to venture capitalist-backed start-ups in technology, life sciences and healthcare, and even Napa Valley wineries, in an era of low interest rates and easy money.

SVB‚Äôs stock has fallen nearly 80% from its record high in late 2021 as interest rates have increased, boosting the cost of the deposits the bank uses to fund loans. The company in its press release on Wednesday said its latest actions were partly due to expectations for a continued higher interest-rate environment and partly because deposit levels have declined.

Given the current volatile economic environment, venture-capital firms have been less willing to fund startups‚Äîa problem for SVB, which gets deposits from VC-backed start-ups that were earlier flush with cash. As of Feb. 28, SVB had client funds of $326 billion, a decline from $341 billion at the end of last year.

‚ÄúWhat we learned over the last 12 to 24 months is that in a fast-paced rising rate environment, customer¬†deposit¬†dynamics are different than what we had expected,‚Äù said Chief Financial Officer Daniel Beck in a conference call with Bank of America analysts days ahead of Wednesday‚Äôs update.

‚ÄúConcern over a slow-to-recover VC environment have kept us cautious on SIVB shares and potentially remains a headwind as rates stay elevated,‚Äù said D.A. Davidson analyst Gary Tenner. He rates the stock at Neutral and lowered his target for the price to $200 from $250.

Wedbush‚Äôs David Chiaverini maintained a Neutral stance as well. The analyst said his rating is based on SIVB‚Äôs growth normalizing after an exceptional run ‚Äúand our belief that the VC market could remain challenged for the next couple quarters.‚Äù

SVB company said it now expects growth in loans in the high single digits for the full 2023 fiscal year, compared with the double-digit growth it had forecast earlier.",_hiddenscout,278,1678383343.0

stocks,10zy3xp,WBD the sleeping giant waking up,"# WBD

WBD is a media entertainment giant that has had a rough last few years, but since the time I last posted the stock has reached a bottom and has started to climb up again, there are several reasons for this which I will explain on this post.

# 1- Warner success in 2022

As said earlier this has been a rough year for the stock price, the company has a severe debt problem which some believe they are not going to pull through, this has led Zaslav to cut back on projects that did not have great outlook and focus on the diamonds of this company (Wizarding world, Game of Thrones, DC : Joker(2019), Batman(2022)).

This has brought great success in the form of House of Dragon, Hogwarts Legacy, The DC movies and the experiment, The Last of Us which is the latest series that is raging everywhere. In terms of numbers most of this projects broke records, House of dragon premiere broke HBO¬¥s viewership raking up 10 million viewers, Hogwarts legacy is currently the best selling game on the major videogame selling platforms (Steam, Epic games) and The last of us has had the largest surge of viewers of any series from one week to another (22%) from 4.7 million viewers to 5.7 million.

This shows how Warner Brothers is still king of entertainment having the best quality, and it will only get better, since Zaslav has already said he would much rather have a bunch of high quality shows and franchises than to follow Disney, Netflix style of having a shit ton of shows that no one watches or are deemed lower quality. Furthermore, the success of Hogwarts legacy shows how fast wbd gaming is expanding into the broader gaming market to make place for future dlc and expansions, even thought its worth mentioning that Multiversus, a free multiplayer fighting game they released a few months back is basically dead in the water although having posted decent numbers on its release. This is also accompanied by their high revenue numbers on their cable business, the revenue will continue decreasing over the years but it is what Zaslav is using to pivot the company into new and classic ways in which warner studios and discovery can make money, be this the streaming services or the cinema releases.

In short, WBD¬¥s sucess in 2022 in terms of their Entertainment Business, shows how they are picking up pace, and with the incoming revenue from HBO MAX, their cable business and WBD gaming accompanied by the tax write offs on poor outlook projects and layoffs they should be able to get enough revenue to pay their debt

# 2- HBO MAX, Discovery+

As said earlier WBD is boasting great legacy content which keeps bringing people into their streaming services, The Wizarding world, Game of thrones, Adult Swim and all of the Discovery content keeps bringing people into the platform which are expected to grow as these new projects like The last of us get a fanbase.

The Elephant in the room in regards to HBO MAX and Discovery is how will they manage to merge into the new streaming service, this is currently unknown, but the name of the combined service is rumored to be Beam. In regards to Discovery+ , they are still unavailable in a number of regions which represents unexploited markets that sooner or later will be expanded to, this means more revenue towards subscriptions and larger audiences as a whole. The latest numbers concerning to subscribers in the platforms give 92.1 million in combination of both streaming services, they are projected to grow into the 150 million at some point in 2025.

# 3- Comparison with competitors

In terms of valuation analysis via ratios and sales comparison with the competition WBD is showing some great numbers, excluding their P/E ratio.

WBD

P/B : 0.71

P/S : 1.34

P/FCF : 21.55

Sales Q/Q : +211.8%

DIS

P/B : 2.05

P/S : 2.39

P/FCF : 2144.73

Sales Q/Q: +7.8%

NFLX

P/B : 7.44

P/S : 5.11

P/FCF : 99.74

Sales Q/Q: +1.90%

The only company that comes close to WBD in this comparison is PARA, which even though it looks undervalued via ratios, it does not come close in regards of the growth and production of content that WBD can achieve. It has to be said that if you don¬¥t like WBD for anything in particular, the undervalued stock you should see in this sector is PARA

# Debt

This is the main issue why WBD is so undervalued in terms of their share price, their current debt levels are sky high in a macro-economic environment that does not allow for an option to refinance into a lower interest rate payment. With a debt to equity ratio of 1.03 this means that WBD has more than 30 billion dollars in debt, it has to be said than more than in average the coupons they pay for the debt are of 4% annually and the principals are of a very long maturity, more than a decade or two in some cases, this gives a lot of time for Zaslav to develop his plan of restructuring the company into a massive growth cash cow. If the rates where higher and maturity shorter this would mean a really serious issue for the company, but there is plenty of time until the main component of the debt expires to solve this issue, and Zaslav has given it a high priority and is being reduced at a fast pace.

# Conclusion

Since the last time I posted the stock has been on a ride, surfing a harsh macroeconomic environment, getting in lows as below 9$ a share up to the point that all of its successes of the year, its growth outlook and its debt reduction have gotten it up 14.22$ a share, the current rally has helped, but this stock remains severely undervalued with price targets in the 20\`s range.

The next earnings release for WBD is coming in a week or two, I expect it to be a beat which would send the stock into a deeper rally and some nice gains in the way, on the other hand if the stock dumps on earnings I will probably continue buying more if it gets down to the 10$ dollar range in which it sat a few months ago, considering i DCA¬¥d from my first position at 14.37 deep into an average cost of 10.47 I have to admit I have a safe margin until the stock price starts hurting.

This is all I have to say about this Sleeping giant of a company, have a great weekend and good luck.

stocks,11n9fcz,"In just a few minutes this week, Powell changed everything on market‚Äôs view of interest rates","* **Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell set out a new paradigm for how the central bank views its policy path, one that apparently will see even higher interest rates for a longer period of time.**
* **Markets now strongly expect a half-point increase in March and the peak, or terminal rate, to hit close to 5.75% before the Fed is finished.**
* **What changed was the January inflation data, plus signs that the labor market remains remarkably strong despite the Fed‚Äôs efforts to slow it down.**

Federal Reserve Chairman [Jerome Powell‚Äô](https://www.cnbc.com/jay-powell/)s prepared speech this week to Congress took just a few minutes, but it changed everything.

In those remarks, the central bank leader set out [a new paradigm for how the Fed views](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/07/fed-chair-powell-says-interest-rates-are-likely-to-be-higher-than-previously-anticipated.html) its policy path, one that apparently will see even higher interest rates for a longer period of time than previously thought.

The aftermath has forced the market, which long had been looking for the Fed to blink in its inflation fight, to recalibrate its own views to coincide more with policymakers who have been warning about a higher-for-longer approach to interest rates.

‚ÄúWe have clearly had a choreographed chorus of Fed speakers for two weeks that was getting us to that place,‚Äù said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management. ‚ÄúIt took Jay Powell, over the course of a very brief prepared statement and a Q&A, to get those expectations cemented into a higher place.‚Äù

As part of his mandated [semiannual testimony on monetary policy](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/watch-fed-chair-jerome-powell-speak-live-in-second-day-of-capitol-hill-testimony.html), Powell spoke Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee then the day after to the House Financial Services Committee.

Heading into the appearances, markets had been looking for the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage point at its meeting later this month, then perhaps two more moves before stopping, with the end point around 5.25%.

That changed after Powell‚Äôs appearance, during which he cautioned that if inflation data remains strong, he expects rates to go ‚Äúhigher than previously anticipated‚Äù and possibly at a faster pace than a quarter point at a time.

Markets now strongly expect a half-point increase in March and the peak, or terminal rate, to hit close to 5.75% before the Fed is finished.

## When the facts change

So what changed?

Basically, it was the [January inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/24/key-fed-inflation-measure-rose-0point6percent-in-january-more-than-expected.html) plus signs that the labor market remains remarkably strong despite the Fed‚Äôs efforts to slow it down. That made Powell, who only weeks earlier had talked about [‚Äúdisinflationary‚Äù forces at play](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/07/fed-chief-powell-says-the-the-disinflationary-process-has-begun-but-has-a-long-way-to-go.html), switch gears and start talking tough again on monetary policy.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs adjusting to data coming in, which the entire board should be doing,‚Äù Hogan said. ‚ÄúIf the facts change again through the February and March data, he‚Äôll likely become flexible on that side and not push this too far to the point where they need to break something.‚Äù

Indeed, Powell said he‚Äôll be watching a pivotal array of upcoming data closely ‚Äî Friday‚Äôs nonfarm payrolls report, followed by next week‚Äôs look at the consumer and producer price indexes.

Goldman Sachs economists are holding to their forecast for a quarter-point hike at the March 21-22 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, but concede that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúclose call‚Äù between that and a half point.

Should the Fed have to tilt in the more aggressive direction, Goldman [warned in a client note](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/goldman-warns-that-higher-fed-rates-could-lead-to-sharp-sell-off-in-stocks.html) that it could have market impacts, with stocks selling off ‚Äúmore sharply‚Äù and downward pressure on commodities, plus upward pressure on the dollar.

Stocks tumbled Tuesday then [again on Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/stock-market-today-live-updates.html?&amp;qsearchterm=stocks%20live%20updates) as investors grew more nervous about the Fed‚Äôs future path. Thursday‚Äôs sell-off, however, did trigger a shift lower in terms of expectations for a half-point hike this month, down to 58% most recently, according to a CME Group estimate.

## Worries over consequences

Powell faced some questioning this week over the Fed‚Äôs inflation-fighting strategies.

Some more progressive legislators such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., charged that the rate hikes will result in 2 million layoffs and hurt working-class families disproportionately. Powell countered that inflation also is hammering those at the bottom end of the income spectrum.

‚ÄúThis is what he is supposed to do,‚Äù Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at advisory firm RSM, said of Powell‚Äôs evolving policy stances. ‚ÄúJay Powell is a punching bag in Washington at this point. He‚Äôs going to take the blame for establishing price stability. If he does that well, in the years to come he‚Äôll be venerated. People will speak very highly of him.‚Äù

Brusuelas is among those who think the Fed should accelerate its inflation battle with a half-point rate hike.

However, he said policymakers could be swayed by a potentially softer jobs report and inflation data next week that reverses course and shows price increases abating. Economists expect that payrolls grew by 225,000 in February, according to Dow Jones, and there‚Äôs widespread belief that [January‚Äôs 517,000 surge](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/03/jobs-report-january-2023-.html) will be revised down in this report, perhaps significantly.

‚ÄúThe economy is just too resilient at this point,‚Äù Brusuelas said. ‚ÄúThey need to generate sufficient labor slack to cool off the economy.‚Äù

Slack was not evident in this week‚Äôs Labor Department report of [job openings in January](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/job-openings-declined-in-january-but-still-far-outnumber-available-workers.html), which outnumbered available workers by a 1.9 to 1 margin.

Data like that could push the Fed into even further tightening, according to economists at Nomura. The firm said future actions could include adjustments to the Fed‚Äôs program to slash its bond portfolio, with one option being to remove the $95 billion monthly reduction cap currently in place.

For the moment, markets are continuing to price in higher rates.

Though Powell made a special point Wednesday to emphasize that no decision has been made yet on the March rate move, markets essentially ignored him. Traders in the futures market were pricing in a terminal rate of 5.625% later this year, well above where it was before Powell spoke.",morelos555,265,1678408863.0

Add in the Biden admin drawing down the SPR to its lowest level in 40 years with the annual rise in Oil/RBOB upon us which will only drive inflation up. So what now?

Much to popular belief, the tech bubble burst in 2001 because of yields. Once the 2-year reaches a certain yield, firms will move money for that return and sit easy. In other words, we call that ‚Äúpaid to wait.‚Äù We can see it playing out now. Add that credit usage is maxed out (good earnings/poor guidance scenario we are seeing now). Here is a breakdown:

1) Yields will continue to rise the next 1-2 months. Inflation numbers move up.

2) Companies continue to lower guidance.

3) Now this is where it‚Äôs important: WATCH the 2 year. High 5s/low 6s is concerning.

4) Outflow of equities into fixed income.

5) Major pain in indexes. Bearish targets will be hit here with no QE to save it.

**Importants Lines From Warren:**   

1. ""We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire‚Äôs consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire.""                          
 Currently Berkshire hold $93B in T-Bills, $36B in Cash, and $25B in Fixed Maturity 
2. **Capitalism has two sides: The system creates an ever-growing pile of losers while concurrently delivering a gusher of improved goods and services. Schumpeter called this phenomenon ‚Äúcreative destruction.‚Äù** 
3. ‚ÄúEfficient‚Äù markets exist only in textbooks. In truth, marketable stocks and bonds are baffling, their behavior usually understandable only in retrospect.
4. The Secret Sauce:  ""Berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the 400 million shares of Coca-Cola we now own. The total cost was $1.3 billion‚ÄìThe cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million.  American Express is much the same story. Berkshire‚Äôs purchases of Amex were essentially completed in 1995 and, coincidentally, also cost $1.3 billion. Annual dividends received from this investment have grown from $41 million to $302 million.  At yearend, our Coke investment was valued at $25 billion while Amex was recorded at $22 billion. Each holding now accounts for roughly 5% of Berkshire‚Äôs net worth, akin to its weighting long ago.
5. The lesson for investors: The weeds withers away in significance as the flowers bloom. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and live into your 90s as well.
6. When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive).
7. **Finally, an important warning: Even the operating earnings figure that we favor can easily be manipulated by managers who wish to do so. Such tampering is often thought of as sophisticated by CEOs, directors and their advisors. Reporters and analysts embrace its existence as well. Beating ‚Äúexpectations‚Äù is heralded as a managerial triumph. That activity is disgusting. It requires no talent to manipulate numbers: Only a deep desire to deceive is required. ‚ÄúBold imaginative accounting,‚Äù as a CEO once described his deception to me, has become one of the shames of capitalism.**
8. **I have been investing for 80 years‚Äì more than one-third of our country‚Äôs lifetime. Despite our citizens‚Äô penchant‚Äì almost enthusiasm‚Äì for self-criticism and self-doubt, I have yet to see a time when it made sense to make a long-term bet against America.

[Bloomberg article about Blackstone default](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-02/blackstone-defaults-on-531-million-nordic-property-backed-cmbs). Some snippets:

> Blackstone Inc. defaulted on a ‚Ç¨531 million ($562 million) bond backed by a portfolio of Finnish offices and stores as rising interest rates hit European property values. 
> 
> Blackstone, which acquired landlord Sponda Oy in 2018, sought an extension from holders of the securitized notes to dispose of assets and repay the debt, according to people with knowledge of the plan. Bondholders voted against a further extension, the people said, asking not to be identified as the sales process was not public. 

> Property values are dropping in Europe as rising interest rates put off buyers until a clearer picture about how far rates will rise emerges. That‚Äôs led to wide gaps between bids and offers, crimping deal volumes and putting pressure on owners with loans that are maturing. About a third of all loans in commercial-mortgage backed securities maturing in 2023 and 2024 face high refinancing risks, according to a study published by Scope Ratings in January.

Is this a 'default' in the sense that it was more economic to just not pay even if the ability was there, or was it a forced default? Market seems unphased.

> Defaults don‚Äôt necessarily mean owners are giving up on offices entirely. In many cases, such as GFP‚Äôs Madison Avenue tower, the investors are looking to negotiate better terms with lenders, or explore other options such as converting the buildings to apartments. 

[Brookfield also defaulted](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-01/work-from-home-high-interest-rates-put-92-billion-in-office-mortgages-at-risk) recently, on ""$1.7 billion of mortgage notes.""

> The clock is ticking for more office owners with the Federal Reserve on the path to raising its benchmark rate even higher, more than 17% of the entire US office supply vacant and an additional 4.3% available for sublease. Nearly $92 billion in debt for those properties from nonbank lenders comes due this year, and $58 billion will mature in 2024, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. 

From the Blackstone article:

> Brookfield Property Partners, which owns a range of real estate including office and retail spots, said in a Feb. 24 filing that it had stopped payment on only about 2% of all of its properties while trying to negotiate a modification or restructuring of its debt.

[Graph of maturity schedule](https://i.imgur.com/fzeRnNd.png) of nonbank office debt.

> About 48% of debt on office properties that matures this year has a variable rate, according to Newmark Group Inc.

> Landlords often have to purchase interest rate caps, which limit payment increases when rates rise and have also become more expensive.  The price for one-year protection on a $25 million loan with a 2% rate cap soared to $819,000 in February from $33,000 in early March 2022, according to Chatham Financial.

> Even for owners who haven‚Äôt defaulted, the math has become a lot more complicated. Blackstone Inc.‚Äôs Willis Tower in Chicago, for example, has roughly $1.33 billion of commercial mortgage-backed securities and has seen monthly payments on that debt jump nearly 300% in February from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A Blackstone spokeswoman said the building is highly occupied with long lease terms.

Shareholder letter: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000187417823000006/rivian_q4-2022xsharehold.htm

Electric vehicle startup Rivian Automotive reported mixed fourth-quarter earnings and a lackluster production outlook after the bell Tuesday.

Shares of Rivian were down by roughly 8% during extended trading. The stock closed Tuesday at $19.30 a share, up 4.6% for the session.

Here‚Äôs how Rivian performed in the period, compared with analysts‚Äô estimates as compiled by Refinitiv:

Adjusted loss per share: $1.73 vs. $1.94 estimated

Revenue: $663 million vs. $742.4 million estimated

The company reported an adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of nearly $5.2 billion in 2022, narrower than guidance of a $5.4 billion loss in November.

For 2023, Rivian forecast vehicle production of 50,000 vehicles. That would be roughly double last year‚Äôs amount but below expectations of roughly 60,000, as estimated by several Wall Street analysts.

‚ÄúSupply chain continues to be the main limiting factor of our production; during the quarter we encountered multiple days of lost production due to supplier shortages. We expect supply chain challenges to persist into 2023 but with better predictability relative to what was experienced in 2022,‚Äù the company said in its letter to shareholders.

Rivian said it expects to achieve a positive gross profit in 2024. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $1.7 billion ‚Äî a narrower result than the $2.5 billion loss it reported a year earlier. Quarterly revenue of $663 million jumped from $54 million in the year-earlier period when the company had just started making its first products.

The results follow difficult times for the electric vehicle startup that have included slower-than-expected production, unexpected pricing pressure and plans to lay off 6% of its workforce in a bid to conserve cash.

Rivian is focusing on ramping up production of its R1 truck and SUV as well as an electric delivery van it builds for Amazon, its largest individual shareholder.

As of the end of last year, the company had about $12.1 billion in cash remaining, down from $13.8 billion at the end of the third quarter and $15.5 billion as of June 30. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $294 million compared to $455 million during the year-earlier period.

Rivian said while inflation has been a factor in its supply chain, it will continue to take steps to ramp up production and reduce material costs by slimming down its engineering and vehicle design, along with commercial cost-down efforts.

The company‚Äôs forthcoming R2 model, for example, will use a simplified assembly and sourcing process to achieve ‚Äúa meaningfully lower cost structure,‚Äù CEO RJ Scaringe said on an analyst call following the earnings report.

He added the automaker is ‚Äúin a very different position with our supply chain today‚Äù relative to a year ago, which will help the company execute on more ‚Äúaggressive cost and pricing‚Äù measures.

‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt necessarily be a linear path over the course of the next several quarters but we will start to see those impacts as early as Q1 as we start to reduce the material costs in our vehicles and the technology introductions,‚Äù said Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough.",Puginator,193,1677641890.0

President Joe Biden has been touting his new alternative minimum tax on the nation‚Äôs most profitable companies, even using his State of the Union address to declare: ‚ÄúNow, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15%. God love them.‚Äù

Other companies that aren‚Äôt yet subject to the tax, like vacation-rental giant Airbnb, may be able to slash their tax bills significantly and stay below 15% once they do have to start paying it.

The reason? Covid-19.

Electric heavy-truck maker Nikola said Thursday it produced 133 battery-electric trucks in the fourth quarter, but delivered just 20 to dealers, generating revenue that fell well short of Wall Street‚Äôs expectations.

Nikola said it made a series of changes to its battery-electric truck during the quarter in response to feedback from early customers. The company also confirmed that the fuel-cell version of its truck is still on track to begin production in the second half of 2023, in line with earlier guidance.

The stock fell more than 5% Thursday.

Here are the key numbers from Nikola‚Äôs fourth-quarter earnings report, compared with Refinitiv consensus estimates:

Adjusted loss per share: 37 cents vs. 43 cents expected

Revenue: $6.6 million vs. $32.1 million expected

Nikola‚Äôs fourth-quarter net loss was $222.1 million, or 46 cents per share. The truck maker lost $159.4 million, or 39 cents per share on a GAAP basis, in the year-ago period.

As of Dec. 31, Nikola had $233.4 million in cash and equivalents available, down from $315.7 million at the end of September.

Nikola‚Äôs fourth-quarter production brought it to 258 trucks built in 2022. That was just enough to hit the guidance range it provided in November, when it said it expected to produce between 255 and 305 trucks for the full year.

Production should ramp up somewhat in 2023. Nikola said investors should expect it to deliver between 250 and 350 battery-electric trucks and 125 to 150 of its upcoming fuel-cell trucks this year. The company also expects to reduce costs on its battery-electric trucks by about $105,000 per truck by year-end as it realizes savings from its acquisition of battery-pack maker Romeo Power.",Puginator,179,1677187452.0

""Tesla's presence in Malaysia is expected to create skilled and better paying job opportunities for workers in the battery electric vehicles segment and increase the participation of local companies in the Tesla ecosystem both domestically and globally,"" it said.

The ministry said it is facilitating Tesla's entry to the country through a new initiative to boost demand for battery-powered electric vehicles and develop an entire ecosystem in the country.

The initiative aims to attract investments from top international electric-vehicle manufacturing companies to Malaysia and Tesla was the first applicant of this initiative, the ministry added.

Facebook parent company Meta is preparing for a fresh round of job cuts, deputizing human resources, lawyers, financial experts and top executives to draw up plans to deflate the company‚Äôs hierarchy, in a reorganization and downsizing effort that could affect thousands of workers.

Meta plans to push some leaders into lower-level roles without direct reports, flattening the layers of management between Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the company‚Äôs interns, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on about internal matters. Other managers may end up overseeing a higher number of employees as their teams grow bigger. Some inside Meta expect employees whose jobs have been converted to eventually quit, trimming the company‚Äôs workforce by default.
In addition to targeting managers, the company is also considering more traditional cuts, including slashing some projects and jobs, the person said. These efforts, which are targeted at divisions across the company and around the world, may not happen on a single day, but will likely roll out across the company in the coming months.

The job eliminations arrive after Zuckerberg sought to reassure workers that he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúanticipate more layoffs‚Äù after the company slashed 11,000 jobs ‚Äî roughly 13 percent of its workforce ‚Äî in November. At the time, Zuckerberg told remaining employees the company had made a substantial cut to ‚Äúminimize the chance of having to do broad layoffs like this for the foreseeable future,‚Äù according to a recording of the companywide meeting reviewed by The Washington Post.

‚ÄúI obviously can‚Äôt sit here and promise you that nothing will happen in the future because it‚Äôs a very volatile environment,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúBut what I can say is that for where we are right now, that‚Äôs was I foresee.‚Äù

But earlier this month, Zuckerberg proclaimed 2023 the ‚Äúyear of efficiency,‚Äù promising investors he would trim middle management and speed up the company‚Äôs decision-making, hinting at the possibility of more cuts.

Meta spokesman Dave Arnold declined to comment but directed The Washington Post to previous public comments from Zuckerberg in which he said the company needed to become more efficient.

‚ÄúWe closed last year with some difficult layoffs and restructuring some teams,‚Äù Zuckerberg told investors earlier this month. ‚ÄúWhen we did this, I said clearly that this was the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end.‚Äù",Puginator,159,1677085005.0

Warner Bros. Discovery said it recorded about $11.1 billion in fourth quarter revenue, missing analysts‚Äô estimates, as the media industry contends with a soft advertising market. 

The company‚Äôs TV networks segment ‚Äì which includes cable-TV channels like TNT, TBS and Discovery ‚Äì decreased 6% to roughly $5.5 billion, as advertising revenue took a drop in particular.

Here‚Äôs what the company reported:

Revenue: $11.01 billion vs. $11.36 billion expected, according to estimates from Refinitiv

Loss per share: 86 cents per share

The company reported a quarter loss of $2.1 billion for the period, or 86 cents per share. It was not immediately clear whether that figure was comparable to analyst estimates from Refinitiv.

Warner Bros. Discovery executives began warning of a worsening advertising market last summer, and other media companies, including Paramount Global, have seen it weigh on their earnings.

The company, which owns streaming services HBO Max and Discovery+, said its global direct-to-consumer streaming subscriber base increased by 1.1 million to 96.1 million by the end of the quarter. 

Revenue for the streaming segment was up 6%, the company said Thursday, driven by an uptick in subscriber growth for its ad-supported tiers.

However, losses for its streaming segment improved, with a loss of $217 million, ‚Äúa $511 million year-over-year improvement in losses,‚Äù the company said. 

Warner Bros. Discovery reported continued softness in the advertising market, which has been weighing on its revenue since last summer, when executives first warned of a slowdown in ad spending. Last week, Paramount Global reported a decrease in quarterly revenue due to lower ad spending.

Shares of Snowflake Inc. fell more than 7% in after-hours trading Wednesday after the data-software company beat expectations with its latest quarterly results but forecast lower revenue for the full year than analysts had been anticipating.

The company generated a fiscal fourth-quarter net loss of $207 million, or 64 cents a share, compared with a loss of $132 million, or 43 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. On an adjusted basis, Snowflake [**SNOW,** **+0.08%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/SNOW?mod=MW_story_quote) earned 14 cents a share, up from 10 cents a share a year before, whereas the FactSet consensus was for 4 cents a share.

Snowflake posted $589 million in revenue, up from $384 million a year before, while analysts were expecting $576 million. Product revenue rose to $555 million from $360 million and ahead of the FactSet consensus, which was for $542 million.

The company had a 158% net revenue retention rate in the quarter.

For the fiscal first quarter, Snowflake‚Äôs management expects $568 million to $573 million in product revenue, whereas the FactSet consensus was for $582 million.

For the full year, Snowflake executives expect $2.705 billion in product revenue, representing 40% growth from a year before. The FactSet consensus was for $2.826 billion. Snowflake gave an initial full-year product revenue forecast calling for 47% growth on its prior earnings call in late November.

TLDR

Campbell Harvey made a name for himself when he published his dissertation back in 1986.

‚ÄúMy yield-curve indicator has gone code red, and it‚Äôs 8 for 8 in forecasting recessions since 1968 ‚Äî with no false alarms,‚Äù Harvey, now a professor at Duke University‚Äôs Fuqua School of Business, said in a interview Tuesday. ¬†‚ÄúI have reasons to believe, however, that it is flashing a false signal.‚Äù

One of the reasons is the fact the yield curve-growth relation has become so well known and widely covered in popular media that now it impacts behavior, he said. The awareness induces companies and consumers to take risk-mitigating actions, such as increasing savings and avoiding major investment projects ‚Äî which bode well for the economy.

Another boost to the economy is coming from the job markets, where the current excess demand for labor means laid-off workers will likely find new positions more quickly than usual. In addition, he said, given the largest job cuts so far have been in the tech sector, those highly skilled recently fired workers are also not apt to be unemployed for very long.

‚ÄúIn science we use models all the time, and they‚Äôre simplifications of reality,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd part of the skill of the scientist is to know when to deploy the model and when not to or, in other words, to know the limitations of the model. And maybe I‚Äôm in a good position of knowing the limitations, given that it‚Äôs my model.‚Äù

Coca-Cola on Tuesday reported quarterly revenue that beat analysts‚Äô expectations, driven by higher prices on its drinks.

But those higher prices have hurt demand for Coke products like Simply Orange Juice and Fairlife Milk. Coke said its unit case volume, which strips out the impact of currency and price changes, fell 1% in its fourth quarter.

Here‚Äôs what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:


Earnings per share: 45 cents adjusted vs. 45 cents expected


Revenue: $10.13 billion vs. $10.02 billion expected


The beverage giant reported fourth-quarter net income attributable to the company of $2.03 billion, or 47 cents per share, down from $2.41 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding an impairment charge tied to its Russian business and other items, Coke earned 45 cents per share.

Net sales rose 7% to $10.13 billion, driven by 12% growth in pricing and a more expensive mix of drinks sold.

Unit case volume was flat in North America and slipped 5% in its Europe, Middle East and Africa segment. CEO James Quincey said last quarter that European consumers were changing their behavior in response to soaring inflation.

‚ÄúIt looks like the European economy is going to avoid a technical recession, but clearly consumer demand is softening, and I think that‚Äôs likely to continue into the rest of the year,‚Äù he said on Tuesday.

He added that Coca-Cola‚Äôs U.S. business is still performing well and the reopening of China will likely boost sales this year.

The Atlanta-based company has been using a two-pronged strategy to appeal to a wide range of consumers. In addition to raising prices, it‚Äôs also been trying to offer more affordable options targeted at lower-income customers. Quincey also said that the company has to ‚Äúearn the right to take price.‚Äù

Both Coke‚Äôs sparkling soft drinks segment and its water, sports, coffee and tea division reported flat volume for the quarter, although there were some bright spots. Coke Zero Sugar‚Äôs volume climbed 9%, and its coffee business saw volume increase 11% as the company expanded its Costa brand.

The weakest spot was Coke‚Äôs juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages segment, which saw its volume shrink 7% in the quarter. The company said the suspension of its Russian business weighed on the division.

For 2023, Coke projects comparable revenue growth of 3% to 5% and comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5%. Wall Street was forecasting revenue growth of 3.9% and earnings per share growth of 3% for the year.

‚ÄúInflation is likely to moderate as we go through the year, and therefore we expect the rate in which prices are going to increase will start to moderate and become more normal by the end of the year,‚Äù James said on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box‚Äù on Tuesday.",Puginator,143,1676386848.0

Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods‚Äò on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected profit outlook for the year and increased its annual dividend as it tightens inventory, expands stores, and keeps margins high.

The sports retailer (ticker: DKS) said it expects 2023 fiscal year earnings to be between $12.90 and $13.80. That‚Äôs higher than the $12 consensus among analysts tracked by FactSet .

CEO Lauren Hobart said the company will grow its sales and earnings in 2023 partly through increasing its square footage and higher merchandise margin. Dick‚Äôs sells sports equipment, apparel, footwear, and accessories.

The company reported same-store sales growth of 5.3% in the fourth quarter, more than double the estimates of 2.1%, according to FactSet. Same-store sales refer to revenue from stores opened for 14 full months.

The stock moved up nearly 8% to $141.94 after markets opened on Tuesday. It‚Äôs up 10% this year, as of Monday‚Äôs close.

Dick‚Äôs has been beating earnings estimates over the past year despite other retailers struggling in an inflationary environment. Part of it has to do with the company‚Äôs positioning: Dick‚Äôs has routinely emphasized it‚Äôs a ‚Äúnecessity-based‚Äù retailer. Some of its categories, such active lifestyle and team sports, feed habits that people have adopted, and which continue to remain resilient despite hard economic times, Chief Financial Officer Navdeep Gupta said late last year.

Plus, the company serves different demographics‚Äîchildren‚Äôs soccer cleats range in price from about $24.99 to $279.99.

‚ÄúConsumers are going through a lot of challenges with grocery prices and gas prices,‚Äù said Hobart in September last year when recession alarm bells were ringing loudly. But ‚Äúeverybody \[is\] just making the choices that are right for them.‚Äù

The moves by Dick‚Äôs allowed the retailer to more than double its annual dividend on Tuesday to $4 per share, from $1.95 per share in 2022. The company ‚Äúnow has among the highest yield in our Retailing/Broadlines & Hardlines space,‚Äù Michael Baker, an analyst at D.A. Davidson wrote Tuesday. He has a Buy rating on the stock 

Advance Auto Parts (AAP) and Best Buy (BBY) are the only two stocks in Baker‚Äôs sector coverage that beat Dick‚Äôs 3% dividend yield. The average yield among the group is 2.3%.

To be sure, the company‚Äôs inventory levels were elevated last year as it struggled with supply-chain disruptions like other retailers. At the end of the second quarter inventory was 49% higher than the same period the previous year, by the end of the third quarter it was 35% higher, but by the end of the fourth quarter (which ended in January) it was down to 23% higher. 

The company also reported $2.93 in adjusted earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter, higher than expectations for $2.88 among analysts. Sales were $3.6 billion, slightly beating estimates of $3.45 billion.",_hiddenscout,141,1678204354.0

stocks,11a4r6b,Biden won‚Äôt save the Apple Watch from potential ban,"This is bad news for Tim Cook

Apple will continue fighting California-based AliveCor over the startup's electrocardiogram (ECG) technology. On Tuesday, AliveCor announced that US President Joe Biden had decided not to veto the US International Trade Commission's (ITC) December ruling that could lead to an import ban on the Apple Watch Series 4 and later.

It's unlikely that Apple's watch will be totally banned. But as The Verge pointed out, AliveCor could walk away with a licensing agreement from Apple to use its patents in the Apple Watch.

According to AliveCor, which has around 150 workers to Apple's 80,000, it shared its ECG sensor technology with Apple in 2015 while building a business relationship, The Hill reported earlier this month. In 2018, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 4, which not only introduced an ECG sensor to the smartwatch but also blocked outside heart monitoring apps. AliveCor said this forced it in 2019 to stop selling KardiaBand, an ECG band that the company announced for Apple Watches in 2016.

""We come up with new technologies, and instead of the ecosystem letting us thrive and continue to build on top of the innovations we already have, Apple cuts us out up front, steals our technology, uses their platform power to scale it, and now is basically saying it‚Äôs scaled so it can‚Äôt be cut off,"" AliveCor CEO Priya Abani said, according to The Hill's February 17 report.

In December, the ITC ruled that Apple infringed (PDF) on AliveCor's patent; however, no import ban is currently in effect. That's because AliveCor is currently appealing (PDF) a December ruling by the US Patent and Trademark Office finding that three of the company's patents in question are invalid, as reported by Reuters. As such, an Apple spokesperson told The Verge this week that the ITC's ruling hasn't impacted the Apple Watch yet.

Biden's decision not to veto the ITC's ruling against Apple, reportedly delegated to US Trade Representative Katherine Tai, differs from the last time Apple faced such a ban from the government agency. In 2013, the ITC called for a ban on iPhones and iPads due to Apple infringing on Samsung patents, but then-US President Barack Obama vetoed the ban, following pressure from ""phone carriers and a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers,"" according to The Hill. Before then, no president had vetoed an ITC-issued product ban since 1987, so it was unlikely that Biden would veto December's decision, despite Apple's lobbying efforts reported by The Hill.

With Apple and AliveCor seeking appeals, any mandates regarding the Apple Watch may not take effect for another 18 months, The Hill reported this week.

At the same time, Apple is also battling Masimo over the Apple Watch. In May, the ITC will reveal if there will be an import ban on all Apple Watches except for the SE (from the Series 6 and on) after a January ruling found that Apple infringed on the California and Switzerland-based company's pulse oximeter patent.

Electric vehicle maker Lucid on Wednesday reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of expectations after building just 7,000 of its Air luxury sedans last year amid manufacturing challenges. But the company said it expects to make between 10,000 and 14,000 vehicles in 2023.

Shares of the company fell roughly 7% in afterhours trading.

Here‚Äôs what the company reported for the fourth quarter of 2022:

Loss per share: 28 cents

Revenue: $257.7 million, vs. $303 million, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates

Lucid‚Äôs quarterly revenue marks a sharp increase from the same period last year, when it had just begun production of the Air sedan and brought in $26.4 million. The company‚Äôs bottom line likewise improved, coming in narrower than the 64-cent loss per share it posted in the year-ago period.

The company ended the year with about $4.4 billion in cash and roughly $500 million available via lines of credit, enough to last until the first quarter of 2024, chief financial officer Sherry House told CNBC. Lucid had $3.85 billion in cash as Sep. 30; it raised an additional $1.5 billion from Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Public Investment Fund and other investors via an equity offering in December. The Saudi public wealth fund owns about 62% of Lucid.

Lucid said in January that it produced 7,180 vehicles in 2022, well below its original expectation of 20,000 for the year but enough to beat the lowered guidance it provided in August. But it delivered just 4,369 of those Air sedans to customers before year-end.

‚ÄúOur goal in 2023 is to amplify our sales and marketing efforts to get this amazing product into the hands of even more customers around the world,‚Äù CEO Peter Rawlinson said.

Lucid said it had more than 28,000 reservations for its vehicles as of Feb. 21, down from ‚Äúover 34,000‚Äù reservations in its last update on Nov. 7.

The company said in April that Saudi Arabia‚Äôs government had agreed to buy up to 100,000 of its vehicles over the next 10 years. Those vehicles aren‚Äôt included in its reservation totals.",Puginator,124,1677117825.0

Shares of Roblox popped 24% Wednesday after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts‚Äô expectations on top and bottom lines.

Here‚Äôs how the company did:


Loss per share: 48 cent loss vs. 52 cent loss per share expected, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts


Revenue (bookings): $899.4 million vs. $881.4 million expected, according to Refinitiv


The revenue figure is what Roblox calls bookings, which include sales recognized during the quarter and deferred revenue. Bookings rose by 17% year over year. The company generates revenue from sales of its virtual currency called Robux, which players use to dress up their avatars and buy other premium features in the games.

Roblox reported 58.8 million average daily active users, up 19% from a year earlier. Users spent more than 12.8 billion hours engaged in Roblox during the fourth quarter, up 18% year over year.

The company said average bookings per daily active user was $15.29, down 2% year over year.

Roblox saw bookings swell more than 200% during the pandemic when kids were spending more time on their screens while stuck at home.

CONSUMER PRICE INDEX - JANUARY 2023

The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) rose 0.5 percent in January on a seasonally
adjusted basis, after increasing 0.1 percent in December, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported
today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 6.4 percent before seasonal adjustment.

The index for shelter was by far the largest contributor to the monthly all items increase, accounting
for nearly half of the monthly all items increase, with the indexes for food, gasoline, and natural
gas also contributing. The food index increased 0.5 percent over the month with the food at home index
rising 0.4 percent. The energy index increased 2.0 percent over the month as all major energy
component indexes rose over the month.

The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.4 percent in January. Categories which increased
in January include the shelter, motor vehicle insurance, recreation, apparel, and household furnishing
s and operations indexes. The indexes for used cars and trucks, medical care, and airline fares were
among those that decreased over the month.

The all items index increased 6.4 percent for the 12 months ending January; this was the smallest 
12-month increase since the period ending October 2021. The all items less food and energy index rose
5.6 percent over the last 12 months, its smallest 12-month increase since December 2021. The energy
index increased 8.7 percent for the 12 months ending January, and the food index increased 10.1

stocks,1129an6,"Fed Lorie Logan: ‚ÄúSupply chains can‚Äôt recover twice, so I don‚Äôt see 3% deflation in core goods as sustainable.‚Äù","Fed Logan's giving a speech on inflation today. Below are my notes for the speech. The inflation number likely doesn't include today's CPI.

[https://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/logan/2023/lkl230214](https://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/logan/2023/lkl230214)

This is a very good breakdown of how the Fed views inflation, and how they factor it into their rate hike decision going forward. I'd highly encourage people to read this if you need a primer on the current outlook for inflation.

I've highlighted notable quotes below. She also talked about financial condition, and the market's still trying to analyze what financial condition metrics the Fed monitors. This is because of Powell's comments of ""financial conditions have been steady"" when most financial condition metrics by the market show considerable loosening.

&#x200B;

Now, there has been some progress on inflation in recent months. But the question for monetary policy is not whether there has been some progress, but rather **whether the progress will continue**. **Will inflation return all the way to our 2 percent target, and will it sustainably remain there over time**?

for the last three months of 2022, **headline PCE inflation slowed to an annualized rate of 2.1 percent**. However, **a good bit of that drop in inflation was due to falling prices of oil and other commodities**. **Energy prices**, as measured by the PCE price index for energy goods and services, **fell at a 16 percent annual rate over the last three months of 2022**. But while it‚Äôs a relief to see lower prices at the gas pump, **energy prices can‚Äôt keep falling at this rate forever.**

**Core inflation**, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has **historically been a better guide to where overall inflation will go in the future**. And core PCE inflation was nearly 3 percent annualized for the last three months of 2022, which is significantly higher than the inflation rate the public is counting on us to deliver. ""

**we can break down core inflation into a few more pieces**: core goods, which includes items like cars and clothing; housing services, such as rent; and core services excluding housing. **This last category makes up about half of personal consumption** and includes everything from health care to transportation to entertainment.

**Core goods prices fell at a 3 percent annual rate in the last three months of 2022, partially offsetting rapid increases in services prices**. Goods prices dropped in part because supply chains were recovering from the disruptions of the pandemic. Supply chains can‚Äôt recover twice, so **I don‚Äôt see 3 percent deflation in core goods as sustainable**. It seems more likely that core goods inflation will move up to the prepandemic trend of zero or a bit below, which means we‚Äôll need lower services inflation to sustain 2 percent inflation overall.

Because rents adjust infrequently as leases turn over, i**t takes time for a cooler housing market to translate into lower measures of housing inflation**. Housing inflation was still around 9 percent annualized for the last three months of 2022. But our research at the Dallas Fed suggests that housing inflation should peak later this year.

The larger concern is with services other than housing. **Core services inflation excluding housing has been running in a range of 4 to 5 percent for close to two years, with little sign of improvement**. You could say this is the core of the inflation problem.

**If core services inflation excluding housing remained in its current range**, while other categories returned to their prepandemic pace, **total inflation going forward would settle much closer to 3 percent** than to our 2 percent goal. And **depending on how the U.S. and world economies evolve, inflation could be even higher**. For example, the Dallas Fed‚Äôs business contacts tell us that **China‚Äôs rapid transition out of zero-COVID policies could drive up commodity prices this year** by more than what most people currently expect.

But in addition, because **services prices depend substantially on labor costs**, the outlook for sustainably **returning inflation to 2 percent hinges in large part on what happens in the labor market.**

on average over the past half-year, the **economy has added 350,000 jobs a month, which is still very high**.

Another sign of strength in the labor market is that as of December, t**here were 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person** in the United States. That is **down only slightly from the all-time high of two openings per unemployed person** last March. And it is **well above the ratio of 1.2 openings per unemployed person in 2019‚Äîwhich was thought at the time to be a very strong labor market.**

strong labor market has been driving up **wages, which have been growing at an annual rate of about 4.5 to 5 percent** by a variety of measures.

Over time, to be **able to buy more goods and services with their wages,** workers taken together must produce more goods and services. In other words, **labor productivity must rise**.

In the long run, **if companies‚Äô profit margins**‚Äîor, more precisely, capital‚Äôs share of income‚Äîare **stable, the growth rate of prices will equal the growth rate of wages minus the growth rate of labor productivity.**

Falling profit margins could also conceivably contribute to lower inflation in the short run.

But for **5 percent wage growth to be consistent with 2 percent inflation** on a sustained basis, **productivity would have to rise at a 3 percent annual rate. Yet output per hour worked grew at an annual rate of only 1 and a quarter percent from 2012 through 2019, and there is little indication it has accelerated meaningfully since then**.

Absent a dramatic rise in productivity, it seems likely that sustainably returning inflation to 2 percent will require substantially lower wage growth. That may take time. Respondents to the **Dallas Fed‚Äôs Texas Business Outlook Surveys expect more than 5 percent wage growth in 2023,** which is down significantly from what they saw in 2022 but still quite elevated. Wage pressures have moderated somewhat in the latest national reports on average hourly earnings and employment costs

**To achieve better balance, labor supply will have to increase, or labor demand will have to decrease**

Labor supply has been weak coming out of the pandemic. **Early retirements, deaths and lingering illness from the pandemic have reduced the supply of workers**. So have structural challenges like the l**ack of child care for working parents**. And **immigration fell to nearly zero during the pandemic, though it has since bounced back sharply**. Beyond that, employers tell me that when workers are available, they often **lack the necessary training or skills**.

Both of these tools **push up interest rates for consumers and companies** throughout the economy. Financial conditions have, therefore, tightened significantly. The 10-year nominal **Treasury yield has risen about 2 percentage points, and mortgage rates have risen nearly 3 percentage points**, since the start of 2022. Importantly, in recent months, **real medium-term interest rates as measured by the yields on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities have averaged above 1.5 percent. That is a significantly restrictive level given that most estimates suggest the neutral real interest rate is below 1 percent**

The **most important risk I see is that if we tighten too little, the economy will remain overheated and we will fail to keep inflation in check**. That could trigger a self-fulfilling spiral of unanchored inflation expectations that would be very costly to stop.

when **central banks aren‚Äôt sufficiently proactive in addressing high inflation**, the **road back to price stability is longer, the labor market is weaker, and the scars on the economy can last long after inflation is finally reduced**. We must stay focused on bringing inflation back to target in a sustainable and timely way

At the same time, if **we tighten too much or too fast, we risk seeing the labor market weaken much more than is necessary to control inflation.** Those job losses would be very costly, too, particularly for lower-income households.

**we shouldn‚Äôt lock in on a peak interest rate or a precise path of rates**

The **evidence I‚Äôm looking for to gain confidence in the inflation outlook** includes some **further and sustained improvement in the inflation statistics**, as well as a clear change in the underlying factors‚Äîlike the **imbalance of aggregate supply and demand and resulting very tight labor market**‚Äîthat have been producing high inflation. And I think we need to see the **economy evolving more or less as forecasts predict. When inflation repeatedly comes in higher than the forecasts, as it did last year, or when the jobs report comes in with hundreds of thousands more jobs than anyone expected, as happened a couple weeks ago, it is hard to have confidence in any outlook**.

I will also remain attentive to financial conditions. Ultimately, **financial conditions need to be sufficiently restrictive to restore price stability**. We must remain **prepared to continue rate increases for a longer period than previously anticipated, if such a path is necessary to respond to changes in the economic outlook or to offset any undesired easing in conditions**. And **even after we have enough evidence that we don‚Äôt need to raise rates at some future meeting, we‚Äôll need to remain flexible and tighten further if changes in the economic outlook or financial conditions call for it.**",Malamonga1,118,1676391481.0

1) Company fundamentals and financial strength: Research the company's financial health, revenue, earnings, and growth potential. Look at the company's financial strength, including its liquidity, profitability, and cash flow generation.  


1a) Balance sheet: Look at the company's balance sheet to see if they have manageable levels of debt and a healthy cash position.  


1b) Earnings consistency: Look for companies with a history of consistent earnings growth, as this is a sign of a strong and stable business.  


1c) Financial ratios: Analyze financial ratios, such as price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio, to understand the company's financial health and valuation.  


2) Management team: Evaluate the quality and experience of the company's management team.  


3) Valuation: Consider the current stock price relative to the company's earnings, revenue, and growth potential. Evaluate the current valuation of the stock to determine if it's overpriced or undervalued compared to its peers and the broader market.  


4) Competitive advantage: Look for companies that have a competitive advantage, such as strong brands, proprietary technology, or unique business models, including its brand recognition, intellectual property, and market position relative to competitors.  


5) Growth potential: Look for companies that have strong growth potential, such as those operating in high-growth industries or with new products or services, including its plans for expansion, new product development, and market penetration.  


6) Catalysts: Consider any upcoming catalysts, such as new product launches, industry trends, or regulatory changes that may positively impact the company's performance.  


7) Insider trading activity: Look at insider trading activity to see if company executives and insiders are buying or selling shares. Insider buying can be a positive sign, indicating that management is bullish on the company's prospects.  


8) Analyst recommendations: Review analyst recommendations and price targets to gain additional insights into the company's performance and potential.  


9) Industry trends: Understand the industry trends and competition, and how the company fits into the overall market.  


10) Market trends: Consider how macroeconomic trends and changes in consumer behavior may impact the company and its industry.

stocks,11mtdli,"U.S. won‚Äôt reach a new record in oil production ‚Äòever again,‚Äô says Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) CEO","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/us-wont-reach-new-record-oil-production-ever-again-pioneer-ceo.html

While oil production in the U.S. will continue its return towards pre-Covid levels, limits on refining capacity and inventory mean it will not grow as much as some hope, according to Pioneer Natural Resources
 CEO Scott Sheffield. ‚ÄúWe just don‚Äôt have that potential to grow U.S. production ever again,‚Äù Sheffield told CNBC‚Äôs Brian Sullivan on Tuesday at CERAWeek. To be clear, this doesn‚Äôt mean no production growth. Many oil companies have outlined production increases as part of spending plans this year, though oil companies are now in an era of greater fiscal discipline, not shy about signaling they will favor shareholder rewards like stock buybacks over higher production levels. Sheffield expects growth to top out at a level that was already reached pre-pandemic. ‚ÄúWe may get back to 13 million barrels a day,‚Äù he said, which would match the record high average recorded in November 2019 by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But he added it will be at a ‚Äúvery slow pace,‚Äù taking two and half to three years to match that previous record level.

For consumers, that means gas prices are more likely to stay within the current range, and pricing risk be tilted to the upside later this year. According to the EIA, an average of 11.9 million barrels of U.S. crude oil were produced per day in 2022, below the record in 2019 of an average of 12.3 million barrels per day. The EIA is forecasting a new record for this year, but barely higher, at an average of 12.4 million barrels per day. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have the refining capacity ‚Ä¶ if we all add more rigs, service costs will go up another 20%-30%, it takes away free cash flow,‚Äù Sheffield said. ‚ÄúAnd secondly, the industry just doesn‚Äôt have the inventory.‚Äù The price of a barrel of oil has fluctuated between $75 and $80 this year, well off the $100+ prices seen this time last year. While the level of economic slowdown in the U.S. will be a significant factor as the Fed continues to signal its commitment to higher rates, Sheffield said he sees these current prices as ‚Äúthe bottom,‚Äù citing the demand boom expected alongside the reopening of China. ‚ÄúThe question is when do we break out? I predict sometime this summer to break fast $80, on the way to $90,‚Äù he said. Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub told Sullivan at CERAWeek that the $75-$80 range for oil prices is a ‚Äúsustainable price scenario for the industry to continue to be healthy.‚Äù

The White House has pushed oil companies to use their record profits to ramp up production instead of on buybacks or increasing dividends. ‚ÄúMy message to the American energy companies is this: You should not be using your profits to buy back stock or for dividends. Not now. Not while a war is raging,‚Äù President Joe Biden said at a press conference in October. ‚ÄúYou should be using these record-breaking profits to increase production and refining.‚Äù During his State of the Union address in February, Biden noted that ‚ÄúBig Oil just reported record profits‚Ä¶last year, they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis.‚Äù Biden said U.S. oil majors invested ‚Äútoo little of that profit‚Äù to ramp up domestic production to help keep gas prices down. ‚ÄúInstead, they used those record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders.‚Äù",WickedSensitiveCrew,86,1678371534.0

Charles Schwab lost its bid to end antitrust litigation seeking to unwind its $26 billion acquisition of TD Ameritrade over claims that the transaction slashed rebates and discounts for retail investors.

Walmart on Tuesday topped holiday-quarter earnings expectations, as the discounter said it drew budget-conscious shoppers searching for food, gifts and household items at a lower price.

Here‚Äôs what the company reported for the fiscal fourth quarter that ended Jan. 31, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates:

Earnings per share: $1.71, adjusted vs. $1.51 expected

Revenue: $164.05 billion vs. $159.72 billion expected

The big-box retailer said it expects same-store sales for Walmart U.S. to rise by between 2% and 2.5% excluding fuel, in the fiscal year ahead. It said it expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $5.90 to $6.05, excluding fuel.

In a call with CNBC, Walmart‚Äôs CFO John David Rainey said grocery prices still remain elevated, which is causing shoppers to buy fewer discretionary items.

‚ÄúThe consumer is still very pressured,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd if you look at economic indicators, balance sheets are running thinner and savings rates are declining relative to previous periods. And so that‚Äôs why we take a pretty cautious outlook on the rest of the year.‚Äù

Walmart reported a net income of $ 6.28 billion, or $2.32, up from $3.56 billion, or $1.28, a year earlier. 

Same-store sales for Walmart U.S. rose 8.3%, excluding fuel. The key industry metric that includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year. E-commerce sales jumped by 17% year over year for Walmart U.S.

The company is not only the nation‚Äôs largest retailer. It‚Äôs also a grocery powerhouse, a factor that has steadied sales and driven foot traffic as Americans watch the budget because of high inflation. 

Walmart‚Äôs reputation for value has helped the retailer ‚Äì as has its large grocery business. It is the largest grocer in the country by revenue. 

At Sam‚Äôs Club, same-store sales rose 12.2%, excluding fuel.

The company‚Äôs e-commerce sales in the U.S. increased/decreased TK% compared with the year-ago quarter. 

Shares of Walmart closed on Friday at $146.44, bringing the company‚Äôs market cap to nearly $395 billion. The company‚Äôs shares are up about 3% so far this year, underperforming the S&P 500‚Ä≤s approximately 6% gain during the same period.",Puginator,78,1676981211.0
stocks,117ibgr,TakeTwo stock analysis and valuation - How Zynga distorts the financials,"This post is a summary of my analysis of Take-Two (Ticker symbol: $TTWO). I hope you enjoy reading it and feel free to add your take and agree/disagree with what's mentioned below.

&#x200B;

The article is divided into the following sections:

* Introduction & Fundamental analysis of the business.
* Historical financial performance
* The Zynga acquisition
* The balance sheet
* Assumptions & valuation
* Valuation based on assumptions different than mine

&#x200B;

**Introduction & Fundamental analysis of the business**

Take-Two is a video game company that grows primarily through acquisitions. It owns well-positioned, well-known IPs, such as Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, NBA 2K, Civilization, Mafia, Max Payne, and many more.

In 2022, the company acquired Zynga, a company that owned a significant number of top mobile games, which fits well into Take-Two's portfolio.

Obviously, one of the big risks that come with every gaming company is, what if the next sequel of a popular game disappoints? What if the next Civilization isn't a big hit, what if the next Grand Theft Auto fails to meet the expectations of the gamers? Although Take-Two isn't immune to this risk, owning a large number of popular games allows them to diversify this risk to a large extent. If we take a look at Activision for example, a giant in the industry, the conclusion would be different as 3 of the franchises (Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush) bring roughly 3/4 of the total revenue.¬†

&#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

Before we move into the financials, it is important to note that the fiscal year of Take-two ends on March 31st. Hence, the fiscal year 2022 starts on April 1st, 2021, and ends on March 31st, 2022.

At the moment of this writing, the last publicly available report is as of December 31st, 2022, so LTM (last twelve months) is referring to the calendar year 2022.

The company's revenue grew 16% CAGR over the last 5 years, and a significant portion of this is coming from acquisitions. As Zynga was acquired in 2022, the full effect of its revenue isn't reflected in the financials yet. Its revenues for the LTM were $4,8 billion.

The gross margin has improved over the last 5 years from 43% to slightly over 50%. However, if we take all the operating expenses into account (Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, Research & Development as well as Depreciation and amortization), it seems as if something is going wrong.

The operating margin was fluctuating between 8 and 19%, until the Zynga acquisition. Suddenly, the profitability is down to roughly 0%. To better understand this, we need to look into the Zynga acquisition.

&#x200B;

**The Zynga acquisition**

The consideration for this acquisition was $9,5 billion:

\- 46.3m shares of Take-Two ($5,4 billion)

\- Cash ($4 billion)

\- Equity awards ($0,1 billion)

&#x200B;

The expected outcome of this acquisition by the management is as follows:

1. Revenue synergies of over $500m

2. Cost synergies of over $100m in the first 2 years

3. 14% revenue growth in the next 3 years

&#x200B;

When there's an acquisition, the acquiring company doesn't just take over what's on the balance sheet of the acquiree. Instead, there's an entire valuation and purchase price allocation process that takes place.

Let me elaborate: The accounting standards have very strict rules for recognizing (capitalizing) internally generated intangible assets (such as brands, trade names, etc.). The main reason is, if this is allowed, most companies would do that, which means instead of recognizing an expense, the capital used would be on the balance sheet (amortized over time), and the profitability of the business would be overstated, and would not reflect the actual performance.

However, when an acquisition happens, that's when the intangible assets that have been generated in the past are valued and recognized.

Because of this acquisition, Take-Two recognized intangible assets of $5,5 billion, in addition to the goodwill of $6.2 billion.

What this means is, all of these intangible assets (excl. the goodwill) will now be amortized and part of Take-Two's income statement, decreasing its operating profit by $700m per year and is the explanation for the significant decrease in the operating margin. However, this is a non-cash expense. Take-two has already paid for this in the past, so from a cash point of view, it doesn't exist. 

 Let's take a look at how Take-Two (with and without Zynga) compares to the key competitors: 

&#x200B;

|Company|Gross margin|S&M expenses|G&A expenses|R&D expenses|Total operating expenses|Operating margin|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Take-Two|55%|15%|15%|10%|40%|15%|
|Zynga|64%|34%|7%|20%|61%|3%|
|Take-Two (/w Zynga)|56%|23%|18%|15%|56%|0%|
|Activision|71%|14%|10%|15%|39%|32%|
|Nintendo|55%|7%|7%|6%|20%|35%|
|EA Sports|74%|13%|11%|30%|54%|20%|

The explanation above also helps understand why Take-Two with Zynga has significantly worse margins than the two companies separately. 

 

**The balance sheet**

Looking at the financial position, Take-Two has a fairly stable cash position of over $800m, but it rarely holds a significant amount of excess cash. After the acquisition of Zynga, the intangible assets make up roughly 3/4 of the entire balance sheet.

On the other side of the balance sheet, the company has a low level of debt ($1,7 billion, including leases) and it doesn't seem to be interested in increasing its financial leverage significantly.

&#x200B;

**Assumptions & Valuation**

&#x200B;

To value Take-two, there are two main inputs required: Revenue growth over time & Operating margin. Here are my assumptions:

**Revenue growth:**¬†25% in year 1 (mainly driven by the Zynga acquisition), followed by 8% until year 5 and a decrease to 3.5% by year 10, this represents revenue growth of 114% in the next decade.

**Operating margin:**¬†16% for the next year, improving to 18% over time as synergies kick in.

**Discount rate (WACC-based)**: 7.78% increasing to 8.02% by year 10 (approaching a beta of 1, vs. the beta of 0.9 today)

Here's the outcome:¬†The company's value is **$14.5b ($86/share).**

 

**Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**

If you have different assumptions regarding the revenue 10 years from now, as well as the operating margin, I hope the table below helps in valuing Take-two as a whole.

 

|Revenue / Op. margin|14%|18%|22%|26%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|100% ($9,7b)|$52.0|$79.6|$105.8|$128.0|
|114% ($10,3b)|$56.6|$86.2|$114.2|$137.9|
|150% ($12,1b)|$64.9|$98.9|$131.2|$159.0|
|200% ($14,5b)|$76.2|$116.1|$154.4|$187.6|

As with any other company, there is a wide range of outcomes. Personally, I think the company is doing well and I'd love to own shares sometime in the future, but not at today's price.

If Take-two increases its margins significantly and moves closer to Activision/Nintendo, the company could be undervalued at today's price.

One important topic to mention is GTA6 as it is a game anticipated for quite a long period of time. Although its (lack of) success will have an impact on Take-two as a company, it is important to acknowledge that it is not the only game that's a cash cow, but it does represent a risk/opportunity in the short and medium-term.",k_ristovski,74,1676921918.0

*****
> Stocks rose Friday as Treasury yields eased from their recent highs and investors weighed the cumulative impact from Fed hikes already implemented and digested this week‚Äôs comments from the central bank.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 387.40 points, or 1.17%, to 33,390.97. The S&P 500 climbed 1.61% to 4,045.64, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.97% to close at 11,689.01.
*****
> The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury note dipped below the 4% threshold. Traders have been watching 4% as the key level on the 10-year that could trigger another down move in stocks. At times this week when the 10-year rate rose above that point, stocks retreated.
*****
> The 10-year Treasury is a benchmark rate that influences mortgages and car loans, so a breakout in the yield could ripple through the economy.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe stock market is very sensitive to bond yields at this point and looking for some respite to the recent upward moves in yields,‚Äù said Yung-Yu Ma, BMO Wealth Management chief investment strategist. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a nervous anticipation to upcoming data releases for jobs and inflation after the difficult readings last month. The market is unlikely to have sustained traction until data points resume a cooling trend.‚Äù
*****
> All of the major averages notched a winning week. The Dow posted a 1.75% gain and snapped a four-week losing streak. The S&P 500 closed up 1.90% on the week and its first positive week in the last four. The Nasdaq ended the week 2.58% higher.
*****
> Market sentiment got a boost Thursday after Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he thinks the central bank can keep its interest rate hikes to 25 basis points rather than the half-point increase favored by some other officials.
*****
> However, Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller struck a tougher tone in his comments to the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America, raising the possibility of a higher terminal rate if inflation numbers don‚Äôt cool. He referred to January‚Äôs big payrolls report, which showed the economy added 517,000 jobs, as well as the latest reading from the consumer price index and personal consumption expenditures reports.

> # End of Q1 Impacts March Trading

> Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to ‚Äúbeware the Ides of March‚Äù but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have had a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month.

> Over the recent 21-year period, March has tended to open well with gains accumulating over its first three trading days. A brief bout of weakness follows before all indexes begin moving modestly higher into mid-month through month‚Äôs end.

> March packs a rather busy docket. It is the end of the first quarter, which brings with it Triple Witching and an abundance of portfolio maneuvers from The Street. March Triple-Witching Weeks have been quite bullish in recent years. But the week after is the exact opposite,

> In March 2020, DJIA plunged nearly 4012 points (-17.3%) during the week ending on the 20th. Solid late-March gains in 2009 and again in 2020 have improved average second half of March performance, but most bullish days are still in the first half of the month.

> # Sentiment Back to Bearish

> The consistency of declines throughout February and to start the month of March has sent sentiment decisively lower. The latest data from the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) showed 23.4% of respondents reported as bullish, up modestly from 21.6% last week but still down significantly from 34.1% two weeks ago. With less than a quarter of respondents reporting as bullish, bullish sentiment continues to sit firmly below its historical average of 37.5% for a record 67 straight weeks.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030223-AAII-1.png))**

> Meanwhile, bearish sentiment has continued to grind higher reaching 44.8% after three straight weeks of increases and hitting the highest level of the short year so far.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030223-AAII-2.png))**

> At the start of February, the bull-bear spread ended its record streak of negative readings as bulls finally outnumbered bears. The surge in pessimism in the past couple of weeks, though, has resulted in more negative bull-bear readings.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030223-AAII-3.png))**

> In addition to sentiment taking a more bearish tone, far fewer respondents are reporting neutral sentiment. After the highest reading in nearly a year last week, only 31.8% couldn't make up their mind this week. That eight percentage point drop from last week was the largest weekly decline since November.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030223-AAII-4.png))**

> In addition to the AAII survey, other weekly sentiment readings have likewise made a quick reversal back towards negative sentiment. Combining the readings of the AAII survey with the Investors Intelligence survey and the NAAIM Exposure Index, sentiment has gone from the most cheery outlook in over a year down to pessimism right in line with the rest of the past year. In fact, the 1.36 point decline since the high three weeks ago ranks as the seventh largest decline in such a span since the composite begins in 2006.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030223-AAII-5.png))**

> Since sentiment is a contrarian indicator, the sharp bearish turn across these sentiment indicators 'should' be a signal for positive forward performance. However, that has not exactly been the case historically. In the table below, we show each prior week that the index has fallen at least 1.25 points without having done so in the prior three months. Of the dozen prior instances, performance has been mixed going forward.

> # Home Prices Falling Fast

> Updated data on home prices across the country came out earlier this week when the newest monthly S&P CoreLogic Case Shiller indices were published. This data is lagged by two months, but it gives us a look at where home prices ended the year in 2022.

> Below is a table highlighting the month-over-month (m/m) and year-over-year (y/y) percentage change in home prices across the 20 cities tracked by Case Shiller. It also includes the national and composite 10-city and 20-city readings.

> Home prices fell sharply from November 2022 to December 2022, with the national index down 0.81% and 11 of 20 cities down more than 1% sequentially. New York and Miami saw the smallest m/m declines with drops of less than 0.3%.

> Looking at y/y price changes, while the national index still showed an increase of 5.76% from December 2021 to December 2022, two cities have now seen prices dip into the red on a y/y basis. Seattle home prices fell 1.78% for the full year 2022, while San Francisco prices fell even more at -4.19%. Given the unrelenting pullback in prices over the last six months, we'll see more and more cities dip into the red on a y/y basis over the next few months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/cstable.png))**

> Where home price trends get interesting is looking at the post-COVID action. In the aftermath of lockdowns, government stimulus, and the shift to ""work from home"" in many parts of the labor force, home prices across the country absolutely soared. By mid-2022, the national home price index was up 45% from the level it was at in February 2020 just before COVID hit. Areas on the West Coast and in the Southeast saw prices rise even more, with many cities seeing gains of more than 60% at their peaks.

> Prices finally peaked last summer, however, as rate hikes by the inflation-fighting Fed quickly pushed mortgage rates to levels not seen in decades. Below is a chart showing how much home prices have fallen from their post-COVID peaks seen in mid-2022. The composite indices are only down 4-6% from their highs, but we've seen prices really take a hit out west with cities like San Diego, Seattle, and San Francisco already down double-digit percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/postcovidpeak.png))**

> Given the pullbacks in home prices over the past six+ months, below is a look at where prices currently stand relative to their pre-COVID levels at the end of February 2020. Notably, San Francisco -- which has seen prices fall the most from their highs -- is currently up the least since COVID hit with a gain of 23%. Other cities where home prices are up less post-COVID than the national indices include Minneapolis, DC, Chicago, and Portland. Where home prices are still up the most is in Florida as prices in Tampa and Miami are still up 60% or more.

> # One of These Indices Is Not Like the Others

> Looking across the major US index ETFs in our Trend Analyzer, one stands out (in a negative way) from all the others. At the moment, the Dow is the only major US index in the red on a year-to-date basis as we close the books on February. Even more notable, is the fact that it's also the only one below its 50-DMA. Not only is it below its 50-day, but it is trading firmly in oversold territory sitting over 1.5 standard deviations below its 50-day. Today that dynamic of Dow underperformance continues as the index is falling another 0.3% as of this writing while the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Russell 2,000 are all higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/022823-50-dma-1a.png))**

> In the chart below, we show how far the S&P 500 and Dow are trading (in standard deviations) from their respective 50-DMAs over the past five years. For the most part, the two large-cap indices have tracked one another relatively well in spite of their differences in composition and price calculations. That makes the current situation in which the Dow is oversold without the same applying to the S&P 500 somewhat unusual, albeit not without precedence. While uncommon, there have been periods in which the indices have similarly distanced themselves from one another like most recently in the spring and fall of 2021.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/022823-50-dma-1.png))**

> Although there have been other times in which the Dow and S&P's overbought/oversold readings have deviated from one another, the current example is abnormally large. With a gap of 1.66 standard deviations between the two indices' overbought/oversold readings versus their 50-DMA spreads, today's spread ranks in the bottom 1% of all readings since 1952 when the five-day trading week began. Additionally, such low readings have been exceptionally rare in the past 20 years. Outside of June and September of 2021, August 2015 was the last instance of the spread falling this wide with the Dow underperforming. Looking back even further, 2004 was the only other instance of the past 20 years.

> # Tech Relative Strength Still Negative

> Each day in our Sector Snapshot, we provide updated charts of the relative strength lines of each sector versus the S&P 500. Outside of a brief period last summer, Technology, the largest sector in terms of market cap, has seen its relative strength line sit in negative territory for nearly the whole of the past year. In other words, the broader market has outperformed the Tech sector almost every day for a year straight. In the chart below, we show the one-year relative strength line of Tech versus the S&P going back to 1991. After some of the most dramatic underperformance of the past couple of decades, Tech rebounded, and the sector has now only underperformed the broader market by a little less than 3% in the past year. While Tech's relative strength is not as weak as it once was and is closing in on the first positive readings since the mid-summer, today marks the 131st trading day of consecutive negative readings. That is handily the longest streak in nearly a decade and one of only six other times a streak has eclipsed 100 trading days.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/022823-Tech-2.png))**

> The current streak has yet to come to a close, but in the chart below, we show the performance of Tech and the S&P 500 following the conclusion of each of those prior streaks of 100 or more days. Overall, performance does hold a positive bias with positive returns a vast majority of the time. That being said, the average size of those gains is not exactly impressive. In the case of Tech, the average and median gains are smaller than the norm across these time periods. One year out is the starkest difference with an average gain of less than 5% compared to what has typically been a gain that sits in the mid-teens. Likewise, the S&P 500 tends to underperform the norm one year later, but short to medium-term performance is stronger than the norm. Six-month returns, in particular, have been impressive with a move higher every time and an average gain that is more than double that of the typical six-month performance since 1991.

stocks,11f7pih,"Meta‚Äôs AR/VR roadmap for the next four years: three new Quest headsets, AR glasses in 2027, and a ‚Äòneural interface‚Äô smartwatch","This is Meta‚Äôs AR/VR hardware roadmap for the next four years

During an internal presentation, Meta execs laid out plans for three new Quest headsets, AR glasses in 2027, and a ‚Äòneural interface‚Äô smartwatch.

Meta plans to release its first pair of smart glasses with a display in 2025 alongside a neural interface smartwatch designed to control them, The Verge has learned. Meanwhile, its first pair of full-fledged AR glasses, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg has predicted will eventually be as widely used as mobile phones, is planned for 2027.

The details were shared with thousands of employees in Meta‚Äôs Reality Labs division on Tuesday during a roadmap presentation of its AR and VR efforts that was shared with The Verge. Altogether, they show how Meta is planning to keep investing in consumer hardware after a series of setbacks and broader cost cutting across the company. A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment for this story.

With regards to the VR roadmap, employees were told that Meta‚Äôs flagship Quest 3 headset coming later this year will be two times thinner, at least twice as powerful, and cost slightly more than the $400 Quest 2. Like the recently announced Quest Pro, it will prominently feature mixed reality experiences that don‚Äôt fully immerse the wearer, thanks to front-facing cameras that pass through video of the real world. Meta has sold nearly 20 million Quest headsets to date, Mark Rabkin, the company‚Äôs vice president for VR, told employees during the presentation.

(I‚Äôll have more from this meeting and my thoughts about Meta‚Äôs roadmap in Thursday‚Äôs issue of my newsletter Command Line.)

Three new Quest models


Meta‚Äôs main challenge with the Quest 3, which is internally codenamed Stinson, will be convincing people to pay ‚Äúa bit more‚Äù money than the cost of the existing Quest 2, according to Rabkin. ‚ÄúWe have to get enthusiasts fired up about it,‚Äù he told employees Tuesday. ‚ÄúWe have to prove to people that all this power, all these new features are worth it.‚Äù

Meta has sold nearly 20 million Quest headsets to date

Mixed reality will be a huge selling point, and Rabkin said there will be a new ‚Äúsmart guardian‚Äù to help wearers navigate the real world while they are wearing the device. ‚ÄúThe main north star for the team was from the moment you put on this headset, the mixed reality has to make it feel better, easier, more natural,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou can walk effortlessly through your house knowing you can see perfectly well. You can put anchors and things on your desktop. You can take your coffee. You can stay in there much longer.‚Äù

There will be 41 new apps and games shipping for the Quest 3, including new mixed reality experiences to take advantage of the updated hardware, Rabkin said. In 2024, he said that Meta plans to ship a more ‚Äúaccessible‚Äù headset codenamed Ventura. ‚ÄúThe goal for this headset is very simple: pack the biggest punch we can at the most attractive price point in the VR consumer market.‚Äù

Rabkin didn‚Äôt say whether a second generation of the recent Meta Quest Pro, which received poor reviews from The Verge and others, is coming anytime soon. The closest to what sounds like a successor will be ‚Äúway out in the future‚Äù after Ventura in 2024, when Meta is planning its most advanced headset codenamed La Jolla featuring photorealistic, codec avatars.

‚ÄúWe want to make it higher resolution for work use and really nail work, text and things like that,‚Äù Rabkin said about La Jolla. ‚ÄúWe want to take a lot of the comfort things from Quest Pro and how it sits on your head and the split architecture and bring that in for comfort.‚Äù

Meanwhile, he acknowledged that the current Quest is struggling to keep new users engaged. ‚ÄúRight now, we‚Äôre on our third year of Quest 2,‚Äù he told employees. ‚ÄúAnd sadly, the newer cohorts that are coming in, the people who bought it this last Christmas, they‚Äôre just not as into it‚Äù or engaged as ‚Äúthe ones who bought it early.‚Äù

Rabkin pushed employees to make the sharing of VR content on other platforms ‚Äútrivial,‚Äù redesign the Quest store to make it more ‚Äúdynamic,‚Äù and give developers the ability to do things like automated promotions.

The current Quest is struggling to keep new users engaged

‚ÄúWe need to be better at growth and retention and resurrection,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need to be better at social and actually make those things more reliable, more intuitive so people can count on it.‚Äù 

Even with these struggles, Meta has built an early lead in virtual reality hardware. But its big swings over the coming years speak to the serious competition that‚Äôs about to arrive. Apple is expected to announce a high-end virtual reality headset sometime this year, while Sony just released the well-received PSVR 2 for console gamers. Meanwhile, Apple, Google, Snap, and others are all racing toward something even bigger: augmented reality glasses ‚Äî and that‚Äôs where Meta is hoping its early efforts in the mixed reality space will really pay off.

AR glasses and neural interfaces

Aside from the Quest lineup, Meta also has thousands of employees building future AR glasses and wrist devices for controlling them. The key difference from VR is that the company intends for AR glasses to eventually be worn throughout the day as a replacement for smartphones. Zuckerberg has called them the ‚Äúholy grail‚Äù device that will ‚Äúredefine our relationship with technology‚Äù by the end of this decade.

During Tuesday‚Äôs roadmap presentation, Alex Himel, the company‚Äôs vice president for AR, laid out the plan for a bevy of devices through 2027. The first launch will come this fall with the second generation of Meta‚Äôs camera-equipped smart glasses it released in 2021 with Luxottica, the parent company of Ray-Ban.

In 2025, Himel said the third generation of the smart glasses will ship with a display that he called a ‚Äúviewfinder‚Äù for viewing incoming text messages, scanning QR codes, and translating text from another language in real time. The glasses will come with a ‚Äúneural interface‚Äù band that allows the wearer to control the glasses through hand movements, such as swiping fingers on an imaginary D-pad.  Eventually, he said the band will let the wearer use a virtual keyboard and type at the same words per minute as what mobile phones allow.

The smartwatch will integrate with Meta‚Äôs social media apps and offer health and fitness features

While Meta canned its plans for a smartwatch with a detachable display and cameras, it‚Äôs still working on another smartwatch to accompany its 2025 glasses, Himel confirmed.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want people to have to choose between an input device on their wrist and smartwatch functionality that they‚Äôve come to love,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo we are building a neural interfaces watch. Number one, this device will do input: input to control your glasses, input to control the functionality on your wrist, and input to control the world around you.‚Äù

Himel showed employees a demo of the glasses in which, during a video call, the cameras on the glasses were showing the wearer‚Äôs front-facing perspective at the same time as a selfie view was being shown from the camera on the watch. He said the smartwatch will be an optional upgrade from a paired-down neural band that comes with the glasses, and that it will also integrate with Meta‚Äôs social media apps like WhatsApp and offer health and fitness features.

Meta‚Äôs first true pair of AR glasses, which the company has been internally developing for 8 years under the codename Orion, are more technically advanced, expensive, and designed to project high-quality holograms of avatars onto the real world. There will be an ‚Äúinternal launch‚Äù for employees to test the glasses in 2024, according to Himel. A version won‚Äôt be released to the public until 2027, when Meta will launch what Himel called its ‚ÄúInnovation‚Äù line of AR glasses for early adopters alongside a ‚ÄúScale‚Äù line of the less advanced smart glasses and the second generation of its neural smartwatch.

Himel framed the market opportunity around the almost two billion pairs of regular glasses and hundreds of millions of smartwatches that are sold each year. ‚ÄúIf we can put on shelves a great product at a great price with the right value, we believe we can get into these upgrade cycles and have a lot of growth of our devices,‚Äù he told the room. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on us to deliver.‚Äù 

‚ÄúA business unlike anything we‚Äôve seen on mobile phones before‚Äù

Meta is planning to rely on its existing business model of advertising to help it make money off these future devices. Himel said the company thinks it can make a higher average revenue per user than what it makes currently in social media, thanks to a combination of selling virtual goods, optional add-ons like cloud backups, and AR ads.

‚ÄúWe should be able to run a very good ads business,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs easy to imagine how ads would show up in space when you have AR glasses on. Our ability to track conversions, which is where there has been a lot of focus as a company, should also be close to 100 percent.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre hitting anything near projections, it will be a tremendous business,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA business unlike anything we‚Äôve seen on mobile phones before.‚Äù",msaleem,72,1677687046.0

[Block](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SQ/) stock rose nearly 8% in extended trading after the payments company reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed Wall Street expectations but posted strong growth in gross profit.

Here‚Äôs how Block did versus Refinitiv consensus expectations:

* **EPS:** 22 cents, adjusted, versus expectations of 30 cents
* **Revenue:** $4.65 billion versus expectations of $4.61 billion

Block posted $1.66 billion in gross profit, up 40% from a year ago. That beat Wall Street expectations of $1.53 billion.

Analysts tend to focus on gross profit as a more accurate measurement of the company‚Äôs core transactional businesses.

The company posted a (non-adjusted) net loss of $114 million, or 19 cents per share, for the quarter

Block, formerly known as Square, told CNBC in a call that the company ended the year with 51 million monthly transacting actives for Cash App in December, with two out of three transacting each week on average.

Its Cash App business reported $848 million in gross profit, a 64% year-over-year rise, according to Block. During December 2022, Cash App had 51 million monthly transacting actives, an increase of 16% year over year.

The company, which is run by CEO Jack Dorsey, said its Cash App Card generated more than $750 million in gross profits in 2022, up 56% from the year-earlier period.

Its point-of-sale business, Square, saw gross profit grow 22% on an annual basis to $801 million.

Ford officials said the factory is slated to be the first in the country to manufacture lithium iron phosphate batteries for electric vehicles.

The total cost of the Ford project in Calhoun County is expected to total about $3.5 billion, the automobile giant said.

https://www.motortrend.com/news/rivian-r1t-2022-truck-of-the-year/amp/

Pre orders for their R1T and R1S are above 100K. They‚Äôve delivered about 25,000 cars and there‚Äôs been a lot of sightings unlike other EV cars. 

Let‚Äôs now talk about the stock price. This IPO during the height of 2021 at $78 with a 100B market cap. That‚Äôs some really good timing to raise 13B from the markets. Now the stock trades closer to $20 with a 17B market capitalization.

Their balance sheet is strong with 13B cash according to the last quarter. If you factor in a 2B cash spent this upcoming earnings - the company sits in about 11B cash on 17B enterprise value. Making this a 6B company on 1B TTM revenue. Sounds affordable to me as the revenue ramp will continue. 

This price is really good entry for a long term hold as the company keeps growing. Rivian is your best bet like buying Tesla stock back in 2012.",freshlysqueezelemon,54,1676322916.0
stocks,1103lfq,Old Stock Certificates,"I purchased stock in a company in 1995. That company was absorbed by another company, which was absorbed by another company, and then again absorbed by another company.

I forgot about the stocks. Occasionally I would get these packets which I opened, examined, and then filed away (they were often voting stuff).

Recently, I received a notice the Oracle was buying out the other company at a price of $95 a share. The company handling the transfers told me I needed the certificates. I went through all my paperwork but never received them, even though they claimed it was sent to me twenty years ago.

They are charging a flat fee, plus 8% to replace the certificate, and if I sell I stand to make around 22k. My original investment was $799.

I was wondering, do I have to sell? I was wondering if I hold them, I would just get stock in Oracle? I thought certificates were a thing of the past and today they do everything electronically. So do I really need to go through all this and pay them all that money for a piece of paper?

(edit)

Thanks for all the great advice! I am going to sell the stock and reinvest it as some of the replies suggested. I do have one more question. Is it normal to have to pay in advance for stuff like this? I thought they would take the funds out of my payout from the sale of the stock.

stocks,11gkq9r,Costco Q2 Earnings: Stock slips after mixed results,"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-q2-earnings-stock-slips-after-mixed-results-213931097.html

Costco (COST) posted fiscal second-quarter earnings results Thursday, March 2, after market close that mostly beat expectations. Shares were down more than 2% after the release.

As consumers sought out value and moved away from discretionary spending, the wholesale retailer saw a slight miss in quarterly revenue, coming in at $55.27 billion, but up 6.5% from a year ago. Meanwhile net sales saw a 6.5% increase, to $54.24 billion, up from $50.04 billion.

Here's what Costco reported, compared to Wall Street estimates, based on Bloomberg consensus data:

Revenue: $55.27 billion versus $55.58 billion expected

Adjusted earnings per share: $3.30 versus $3.21 expected

Same-store sales: up 6.8% versus up 6.16% expected

United States: up 5.8% versus up 5.56% expected

Canada: up 9.6% versus up 5.51% expected

Other international: 9.5% versus up 7.10% expected

""People are spending their dollars where they feel they should be spending them,"" CEO Craig Jelinek said on a call with investors. The retailer saw an increase in sales in the fresh food, food, and sundry categories and ""weakness in big ticket discretionary items"" with a drop in non-food items such as apparel, jewelry and electronics. This is similar to results from Target (TGT) and Walmart's (WMT) latest earnings.

In the U.S., sales came in slightly lower than expected, up 5.8% compared to estimates of 5.56%. Meanwhile, in Canada and internationally, Costco saw strength with same-store sales, both higher than estimates, up 9.6% and 9.5%, respectively.

Last quarter, e-commerce sales were down 9.6%.

Giving an outlook into the first few weeks of Q3 FY 23, in the first four weeks of February, U.S. sales are up 3.4% and up 1.2% in Canada. For its international business, sales are up 6.5%. E-commerce sales saw a decline of -11.2% in the month of February. Last month, the company saw net sales of $17.06 billion, up 4.7% from $16.29 billion last year.

Its private label business, Kirkland Brands, is also getting a boost from inflation. In the last few months, the company saw ""a bigger delta than normal"" to Kirkland Brands. For Q2, the company saw a roughly 1.5% increase in sales of Kirkland Brands, specifically food penetration, compared to roughly 0.5% typically. Jelinek jokingly called it a ""trade-up,"" adding, ""People are looking to save money, and it's our brand, that's great, creates loyalty.""

In the call with investors, Jelinek reiterated, similar to previous quarters, ""It's a question of when, not-if,"" it will raise prices. He then referred to its typical time line of membership fee increases, which is every 5 years and seven months, bringing the next potential hike to ... now.

Costco last raised prices in June 2017.

Jelinek remains confident that the wholesale retailer remains on top, saying, ""Our relative level of competitiveness is as strong as it's ever been.""

This quarter, membership fees brought in $1.03 billion, up 6.2% from a year ago and a tick higher than Wall Street estimates of $1.04 billion.

Stifel, which holds a Buy rating on the stock, expects ""greater clarity over the next approximately six months,"" however, that may be delayed due to the current macro environment. ""It is possible a weaker consumer environment and strong comparable store sales and renewal rates could delay an increase relative to historical timing.""

A Costco Gold Star membership costs $60 per year and an Executive Membership goes for $120.

That's compared to Sam‚Äôs Club, owned by Walmart (WMT), which raised prices in August for the first time since 1999. That move increased annual fees to $50 from $45 for Club members and to $110 from $100 for Plus members.

stocks,115ube5,"Profiting from Natural Gas Prices falling below energy producers breakeven prices on February 17, 2023.","Well well well‚Ä¶ look who didn‚Äôt hedge for the price of Natural Gas to fall below the industry breakeven price of $2.80. You guessed it! Nat Gas producers.

Unfortunately for companies like EQT Corp ($EQT), Southwestern Energy Corp ($SWN), Anteroom Resource Corp ($AR), Chesapeake Energy Corp ($CHK), Ovinitiv Inc ($OVV), and others, last year‚Äôs high water mark of over $9/mmbtu in Summer and Fall ‚Äô22 handicapped forecasting models to the possibility of $2.263/mmbtu in Winter ‚Äô23.

In light of this, internal hedging strategies for producers have been too light to cover these price declines. EQT Corp expects to lose $4.6 billion from derivative losses for ‚Äô22 and Southwestern Energy Co expects to lose $6.71 billion in the same period.

How could producers have failed to anticipate prices to fall below breakeven production costs? The answer to that question doesn‚Äôt matter. What matters is how can we turn a profit from their miscalculation.

Here‚Äôs the data:

Nat Gas Breakeven price: $2.80/mmbtu

Nat Gas current price: $2.263/mmbtu

The moving average price of Nat Gas is trending down rapidly, and sits between $3.50/mmbtu and $4.00/mmbtu.

Here‚Äôs the market context:

$BOIL (3x leveraged bull ETF w/ Nat Gas futures underlying) was the #4 most actively traded ticker on the market on Feb 17, 2023 with 82 million shares traded as it was down 11.5%.

Nat Gas prices were last this low in Fall ‚Äô20, in the depths of the pandemic. At this time, the price was above the moving average and began the acceleration to the high of $10/mmbtu in Fall ‚Äô22.

It has taken 6 months for prices to go from $10/mmbtu in Fall ‚Äô22 to $2/mmbtu today.

Here‚Äôs the play:

I‚Äôm placing big bets on energy producers to make moves to bring prices back above breakeven to cover for losses incurred.

If prices rise from $2/mmbtu to $3/mmbtu, $BOIL will go from $5/share to $8/share ‚Äî> a 60% return on simply prices returning to breakeven production costs.

Why do I think this is a good idea?:

Because producers have to at least make breakeven if they want to stay in the game. They are motivated to survive.

Could I be wrong? Yes. But the risk/reward scenario is clearly in favor of a long position in Nat Gas through derivatives or other means to track this underlying.

\> The floor beneath is very close. If the price goes to $0, you‚Äôre not that far away right now anyway. This is unlikely. 

\> If the price goes to $3, back to barely above breakeven and more in line with the historical averages, that‚Äôs an easy profit.

I‚Äôm not saying you should do it, but I am saying I am doing it ;)

&#x200B;

**1) Management Assessment:** 

* A strong management team with a track record of success is important. Does the CEO have a history of successfully leading companies & driving growth? Evaluating the CEO's leadership style and decision-making could impact the company's future success.

**2) Insider Activity:** 

* Insiders like the CEO and members of management have access to information that may not be publicly available. When insiders buy or sell shares of their own company, it can signal their confidence or lack of confidence in the company's future prospects.

**3) Investor Analysis:** 

* Institutional investors have a significant impact on stock price. The level of institutional sponsorship provides insights into sentiment and confidence in the company's future. Look for which institutional investors hold the stock and how much they hold.

**4) Strength Assessment:** 

* Identify the company's strengths to assess its potential for long-term success. Evaluate its products or services, brand recognition, patents or factors that set it apart from competitors. Evaluate growth prospects & catalysts to drive future growth.

**5) Growth Potential:** 

* Assessing how the company plans to scale its operations is also critical in evaluating growth potential. Consider any plans to expand into new markets or geographic regions, as well as any potential acquisitions or partnerships that could drive growth.

**6) Earnings Evaluation:** 

* Look for trends in revenue & earnings growth over time. Has the company grown its revenue and earnings over the past several years, or has performance been volatile? Review its record of meeting or missing earnings expectations.

**7) Valuation Comparison:** 

* Compare the company's valuation to its peers or competitors in the industry, such as P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio and the PEG (price-to-earnings growth) ratio. Look for a reasonable valuation relative to its peers.

**8) Stability Assessment:** 

* Review the financial statements to assess financial position & long-term stability. Evaluate financial strength such as positive cash flows from operations, healthy liquidity ratios & manageable debt levels. Look for sustained growth in its financials.

**9) Peer Assessment:** 

* Analyzing a company's competitors and peers is important. Evaluate how the company stacks up against its competitors in terms of financial metrics, products, and competitive landscape. Is there a competitive advantage or a moat?

**10) Event Assessment:** 

* Updated price targets & analysts' ratings can show the potential upside or downside of a stock, but consider the analysts' track record. Look for developments such as new product launches, major partnerships or regulatory changes that may impact earnings.",TonyLiberty,50,1677118206.0

However,  if this wasn't the case, I would have sold. NVDA appears to be extremely overpriced. And with macroeconomics (inflation especially) I'm positive this is a short lived run up in which I could have bought for lower. All in all, I would have sold and allocated the money into an ETF instead.

The Wall Street Journal reported last June that [NJOY had hired advisers and was exploring a sale](https://www.wsj.com/articles/juul-rival-njoy-hires-bankers-for-possible-sale-11658267834?mod=article_inline).¬†

Altria, the largest maker of cigarettes in the U.S., has tried for years to develop or acquire e-cigarettes as U.S. smoking of [traditional cigarettes declined](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pandemic-cigarette-smoking-boom-appears-to-be-over-11635515952?mod=article_inline). The tobacco giant in 2018 paid $12.8 billion [for a 35% stake in Juul Labs Inc](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-marlboro-maker-bet-on-juul-the-vaping-upstart-aiming-to-kill-cigarettes-11553313678?mod=article_inline)., only to see the vaping market leader tumble**.** 

Juul, embroiled in a dispute with federal regulators and swamped by lawsuits alleging that it had targeted minors, came [close to filing for bankruptcy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/juul-secures-financing-to-avoid-bankruptcy-plans-to-cut-30-of-jobs-11668097803?mod=article_inline) last year. Juul has since [settled much of that litigation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/juul-reaches-settlement-of-over-5-000-lawsuits-11670374226?mod=article_inline) but its future remains in question amid a [dispute with the Food and Drug Administration](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-fda-banned-juul-e-cigarettes-11666374991?mod=article_inline) over whether its e-cigarettes can remain on the U.S. market. Juul has said it never targeted young people and has been working to regain the trust of regulators and the public.

Altria now values Juul at $714 million‚Äîdown from the $38 billion valuation when Altria first invested.¬†

The Federal Trade Commission is expected to issue a decision in March on whether to unwind Altria‚Äôs investment in Juul. The agency‚Äôs staff has alleged that it [violated antitrust law](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-bad-is-our-companys-product-let-us-list-the-ways-11624289696?mod=article_inline). With the Juul case pending, an NJOY deal would likely face regulatory scrutiny.

NJOY has obtained clearance from the FDA to sell its tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes in the U.S., a hurdle that so far has eluded the two biggest brands: Juul and Vuse Alto, which is owned by Reynolds American Inc. Those reviews are still under way.

NJOY is the No. 3 e-cigarette brand in U.S. stores tracked by Nielsen but has a very small market share, representing about 3% of the market. Juul accounts for about 26%.

Altria last fall [ended its noncompete agreement](https://www.wsj.com/articles/altria-decides-to-compete-with-juul-11664538088?mod=article_inline) with Juul. That gave Altria the option to buy another e-cigarette brand or develop its own vaping products, and Juul the ability to sell itself or a stake [to an Altria competitor](https://www.wsj.com/articles/juul-in-deal-talks-with-three-tobacco-giants-11674673730?mod=article_inline).

Tobacco companies are jockeying for position to grab up pieces of the U.S. e-cigarette market as regulators reshape the industry, deciding which products can stay and which must go. The Biden administration has said it plans to mandate the [reduction of nearly all nicotine](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-targets-removal-of-most-nicotine-from-cigarettes-11655842130?mod=article_inline) in cigarettes, adding urgency to cigarette makers‚Äô efforts to find other avenues of growth.

The potential deal for NJOY would fall short of the $5 billion or more some of the company‚Äôs investors hoped NJOY would fetch. People familiar with NJOY said last summer that if talks with potential suitors didn‚Äôt result in a high-enough valuation, the company could raise more money privately and bide its time until undertaking an initial public offering.

But the window for IPOs has worsened. Some companies that went public in 2020 and 2021 [are at risk of being delisted](https://www.wsj.com/articles/oatly-other-deflated-ipo-stocks-haunt-new-issue-market-11671417781?mod=article_inline), and some newly public companies [have reached deals to go private again](https://www.wsj.com/articles/going-private-again-is-all-the-rage-among-newly-public-companies-93fff45e?mod=article_inline).

Still, the deal would represent a corporate turnaround story for NJOY. The company emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2017 via an auction won by Homewood Capital, an investment firm run by Douglas Teitelbaum, and its investors; the bid later was backed by Mudrick Capital Management LP, a distressed investor, which emerged with a 51% controlling interest.

stocks,117wl8c,These Are The Best (And Worst) Performing Stocks Of 2023," Driving stocks‚Äô broad rebound over the first seven weeks of the year are several of last year‚Äôs black sheep, including Tesla, the always volatile electric vehicle company helmed by the U.S.‚Äô second-richest man Elon Musk.

&#x200B;

 Tesla is the best-performing stock listed on the S&P 500 year-to-date, rising 69%, while the other five best-performing S&P constituents are streamer Warner Bros. Discovery (up 63%), biotechnology contractor Catalent (59%), orthodontics firm Align Technology (50%) and the cruise liner Royal Caribbean (48%), according to FactSet data.

Despite spanning industries, each of those companies have one thing in common: They were among the worst-performing stocks of 2022, each losing 35% or more last year.

Other notable gainers this year are fellow streamers Paramount (40%) and Disney (21%), Silicon Valley technology giants Nvidia (46%) and Meta (44%) and other leisure travel stocks like Norwegian Cruise Line (44%) and Caesars Entertainment (27%).

 

The S&P‚Äôs biggest losers are also a diverse group, led by telecommunications firm Lumen Technologies (-25%) and followed by solar energy company Enphase Energy (-23%), specialty healthcare provider Baxter International (-20%), energy company APA Corp (-18%) and pharmaceutical and healthcare giant Pfizer (-15%).

The decline of Pfizer, by far the worst-performing stock of 2023 with a market capitalization over $100 billion, comes after the company [said](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/01/31/pfizer-expects-covid-vaccine-and-pill-revenues-will-fall-60-in-2023/?sh=7c9241f37bee) it expected sales for its Covid-19 vaccine and oral treatment will slip 60% in 2023, and headline an onslaught for several big pharmaceutical companies, with peers Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly down 9% and 10%, respectively, year-to-date.

 

KEY BACKGROUND

The S&P 500 is up 6.7% year-to-date after slipping 18% in 2022, its worst annual performance since 2008. The slump closely tracked the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates from around 0% to over 4% in an effort to slow inflation. In addition to Meta, other mega-cap tech stocks are up dramatically this year, with each of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft up 6% or more.

## TANGENT

Also gaining thus far in 2023 is bitcoin, up almost 50% year-to-date at about $25,000, an eight-month high. Oanda analyst Craig Erlam warned Monday that investors must be wary of the latest rally for the cryptocurrency, explaining: ‚ÄúWe've all seen what happens when enthusiasm and euphoria exist in cryptos,‚Äù referring to bitcoin‚Äôs dramatic 75% nosedive between November 2021 and November 2022.

## SURPRISING FACT

U.S. military contractor Northrop Grumman is the sixth-worst performing S&P constituent year-to-date, [despite](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/02/15/chinese-spy-balloon-graphic-reminder-of-geopolitical-market-risks-heres-what-it-means-for-stocks/?sh=afd798e78889) a recent rally for it and other defense stocks as geopolitical tensions stewed.

## BIG NUMBER

$61.3 billion. That‚Äôs how much Musk has tacked onto his fortune so far this year during Tesla‚Äôs rally, roughly the size of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs total fortune. Musk, who lost his position as the world‚Äôs wealthiest person in December, is $15 billion away from reclaiming the title from LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

They did this a few times over the course of the year. Come to now and I no longer have any shares left in the company.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

*****

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors look ahead to Powell comments, jobs data this week](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/05/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)
*****
> U.S. stock futures were flat Monday as Wall Street looked ahead to a week filled with economic data and the latest commentary from the Federal Reserve.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 43 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 hovered around the flatline.
*****
> Traders are coming off a positive week for the major averages. The Dow industrials added 1.75% last week, ending a four-week losing streak. The S&P 500 advanced 1.90%, while the Nasdaq capped the week with a 2.58% pop.
*****
> Those gains come even as the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose above the psychological 4% level at various points last week. An upward move in the 10-year yield raises borrowing costs for consumers and could signal a drop in investor confidence.
*****
> ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre afraid of a recession, go get the 10-year Treasury,‚Äù Sri-Kumar Global‚Äôs Sri Kumar told CNBC on Friday. ‚ÄúEquities are a losing proposition today, and until you see the valuations come down significantly, just don‚Äôt trust [Friday‚Äôs] rally.‚Äù
*****
> Important catalysts this week include congressional testimony Tuesday and Wednesday from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who will guide investors and lawmakers on how the central bank is thinking about inflation and its rate-hiking campaign going forward.
*****
> Traders are also anticipating the February jobs report on Friday, which follows January‚Äôs blockbuster report that showed the economy added 517,000 payrolls. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting 225,000 jobs added last month.
*****
> On Monday, the latest factory orders data will also be released after the bell. Economists are expecting a decline of 1.8% in January, according to consensus estimates from Dow Jones. That‚Äôs compared to a 1.8% gain in the prior reading.

# [Stock futures rise after major averages suffer biggest weekly losses of the year: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/26/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> U.S. equity futures rose Monday, as traders tried to recover some ground following the worst week of the year on Wall Street. Investors also looked ahead to another big week in retail earnings.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 138 points, or 0.4%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.5%, and Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.6%.
*****
> The major averages Friday ended the day lower and posted their biggest weekly declines for 2023. The Dow finished lower by 3%, its fourth down week in a row. The S&P 500 lost 2.7% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.3% for the week.
*****
> Stocks sank Friday and Treasury yields jumped following a bigger-than-expected increase in the latest reading for personal consumption expenditures, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs preferred inflation gauge.
*****
> The early 2023 rally seems to be fading as investors absorb the minutes of the latest Fed meeting, which reiterated the central bank‚Äôs tough stance on inflation, as well as recent comments from Fed officials cautioning interest rates could rise higher and for longer than anticipated.
*****
> ‚ÄúAs we head into a seasonally weak period, with bets rising that the Fed may go with a 50bps increase instead of a 25bps in March, though still a minority opinion, the short-term market risk remains to the downside despite three straight weeks of losses,‚Äù said Louis Navellier, chairman and founder of growth investing firm Navellier & Associates. ‚ÄúThe bears are dusting themselves off after getting sacked in January.‚Äù
*****

*****
> In the week ahead, investors will be looking for clues about how inflation is affecting consumers and businesses amid a handful of economic data reports and corporate earnings. Durable goods orders are due out Monday morning. Consumer confidence and the ISM manufacturing survey are also on deck in the coming week.
*****
> In earnings, just 6% of the S&P 500 will report but investors are looking for insight into the consumer with several major retailers, restaurants, some travel and entertainment names as well as food companies set to report. Target, Costco, Lowe‚Äôs and Macy‚Äôs are some of the big names set to report earnings this week.

stocks,1127hqq,"RESTAURANTS Burger King-owner Restaurant Brands posts strong fourth quarter, names new CEO","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/14/restaurant-brands-international-q4-2022.html

Restaurant Brands International on Tuesday posted a strong fourth quarter and named Chief Operating Officer Joshua Kobza as its new chief executive, effective March 1, replacing Jos√© Cil.

‚ÄúOver the past several years, the Board of Directors has worked with management to build a thoughtful succession plan for key positions, so this is a natural transition for Josh to lead our next phase of growth,‚Äù Chairman Patrick Doyle said in a Tuesday announcement.

Cil will stay on with the company for a year as an advisor to help with the transition.

The leadership change comes as the company works to revive and expand some of its key restaurants. Restaurant Brands houses chains Burger King, Tim Hortons, Popeyes and most recently Firehouse Subs.

The company reported a slight miss on earnings, but beat on revenue compared to analyst‚Äôs expectations. As the company heads into its new fiscal year with a new CEO at the helm, it is preparing for an ‚Äúaccelerated pace of growth for the next five to 10 years,‚Äù Doyle said on a call with analysts.

Shares of the company fell 5% in early trading Tuesday, despite the largely upbeat report.

Here‚Äôs how Restaurant Brands performed in the fourth quarter, compared with what Wall Street anticipated, based on an average of analysts‚Äô estimates compiled by Refinitiv:

Adjusted earnings per share: 72 cents vs. 74 cents


Revenue: $1.69 billion vs. $1.67 billion expected


For the three months ended Dec. 31, the company reported net income of $336 million, or 74 cents per share, up from $262 million, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier.

Quarterly revenue of $1.69 billion marked a year-over-year increase of about 9%.

Restaurant Brands reported overall same-store sales growth of 8% during the fourth quarter and systemwide sales growth of nearly 12%.

Its flagship burger chain, Burger King, saw same-store sales growth of 8.4% during the period. In the U.S. only, sales grew by 5%. Domestic sales for the Burger King chain have sagged, especially as some franchisees struggle. At the beginning of the year, a Burger King franchise operator with locations in four states filed for bankruptcy.

The company has been working to rejuvenate Burger King‚Äôs domestic sales and in September announced a $400 million investment plan to boost Burger King advertising campaigns and renovate the chain‚Äôs restaurant locations.

At the end of the fourth quarter, the company said it had funded $30 million of that turnaround plan. Restaurant Brand executives said on a call with analysts that though they were pleased with initial turnaround outcomes, they still have ‚Äúreal progress that we need to make in order to continue to drive growth.‚Äù

The company previously said it expects to reap the benefits of the turnaround in 2025.

Tim Horton‚Äôs same-store sales grew by 9.4% during the period. In Canada alone, same-store sales for the coffee brand rose 11%. The chain has been expanding more internationally, especially eyeing Texas and Florida to target Canadians who travel to warmer climates for the winter.

Popeyes saw same-store sales grow by 3.8%. The chain, which saw a spike in sales with its 2019 debut of its chicken sandwich, has since stabilized and saw just 1.5% growth in the U.S.

Restaurant Brands added Firehouse Subs to its portfolio in 2021. That chain saw a 0.4% same-store sales increase during the period.

Restaurant Brands has not been immune to industrywide rising costs and losses in China and Russia. The company said it took less of a hit from Covid-related disruptions during the fourth quarter, though it noted that it had to temporarily close some of its restaurants in markets like China that experienced a resurgence in cases.

It also said that it did not generate any new profits from Russia in 2022 and does not anticipate any in 2023 either. The company last year suspended corporate support for a large Burger King franchise in the country in light of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

Covid and the war in Ukraine have created a tough macroenvironment for the company due to foreign exchange headwinds and climbing interest rates. Restaurant Brands said Tuesday it expects ‚Äúadverse impact on our business‚Äù if it cannot adjust prices to compensate for higher costs.

So far, higher prices domestically have not scared away the company‚Äôs consumer base. Fast-food companies across the industry have seen boosted demand among budget-conscious customers, beating out fast-casual dining options.

Yum Brands reported a strong fourth quarter last week, mostly propped up by its Taco Bell segment as weak China sales weighed on Pizza Hut and KFC. The company credited U.S. momentum to its chains‚Äô affordable options.

Similarly, McDonald‚Äôs profited from changes in consumer spending behavior with a fourth-quarter revenue bump fueled by higher menu prices and increased demand.",Puginator,31,1676386966.0

Linked above is the SP 500 with markers notating peaks and recessions, in its 2001 dot com stock bubble, 2007 financial bubble and the 2021 stock bubble, which are necessary for understanding my reasoning.

Here's my take:  
incoming 2nd recession: probable but not soon  
bear market: over  
stock market: about to take another run up/peak

2 important things of note:   
1. While the yield curve inversions have predicted all of the previous recessions (including the brief but not shown covid recession from feb-april 2020) this does not actually line up with the peaks and troughs in the market as seen in my graphs  
2. Recession happen in Bear markets (as per definition relying on negative GDP growth), but bear markets can happen without recessions

The 2001 bubble had its peak a just barely before the YC inversion.  
The 2007 bubble had its peak a full year after YC inversion.  
The 2020 brief 3 month recession was a result of covid lockdowns and therefore not applicable to our current situation.

So looking at our current market we should be aware that the December 2021 peak  and following 1 year bear market pull back is probably the sole result of covid tech stocks running up and not the long overdue bear market/recession everyone's been talking about incoming. Of course stock market =/= health of the economy. There are plenty of jobs and growth (both through pop growth and tech development) in the economy right now which is probably why the stock market looks as weird as it does right now.

See, with every previous bear market following a peak, the bear market lasts 2-3 years, but almost inexplicably we see a bear market through 2022 lasting less than a year, with the current run up being a positive indicator for the SP500. 

  
My conclusion? We haven't actually seen the top of the market yet.  
Because if we had, then the SP would have continued dropping for the next \~1.5 years, and just because the YC inverted doesnt mean we will IMMEDIATLY see the recession nor does it line up with the top of the market.   
What we do have however is extremely positive growth signals (pop increasing/tech advances), a LOT more money in the market with the average investor in trading apps, more people returning to work, which will likely continue through the next few years. Of course anyone betting against the U.S. market is usually wrong as markets over time trend up logarithmically with bear markets sparse and lasting little more than 3 years. But that's the thing, it continues up LOGARYTHMICALLY and right now we are below that average line looking at the sp500 on a 20 year chart. Another run will happen beating 472 easy, likely followed by an actual bear market and recession, assuming the current YC inversion trends deeper, and doesn't immediately pop back up like it did in 2019, otherwise we may just not see the deep 2-3 year long bear market at all.

One-tenth gave a pet away due to rising costs.

Hi all

I'm not here to shit on anything. But I use to trade options on MPW. There were a few things that were yellow flags for me. Yellow flags meaning they might be issues or could indicate issues but alone are not enough to disqualify MPW for me.

1. High premium usually indicates high risk. REITS that I have looked at usually have option premium more like a value stock. But MPW has premium rivaling Tesla and Nvidia.
2. High dividends are concerns for several reasons. The biggest concern is fundamentals of the company. Another is a possible dividend cut.
3. MPW recently wrote down a pretty substantial amount of money from one of their tenants going into bankruptcy. This was given in their last earnings report/call. This would explain the drop in share price in the last couple weeks.

Then I came across some things online. The info to me turns those yellow flags into big red flags. So I just wanted to share this and get feedback. Links below.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

# **Stocks close lower Friday after hot inflation report; major averages log worst week in 2023: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
> U.S. stocks fell sharply Friday, wrapping up their worst week of 2023, after the Federal Reserve‚Äôs preferred inflation gauge showed a stronger-than-expected increase in prices last month.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 336.99 points, or 1.0%, to end at 32,816.92. The S&P 500 dropped 1% to close at 3,970.04. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.7% to end at 11,394.94. The Dow fell as much as 510 points, or 1.54%, earlier in the trading session.
*****
> The major averages also ended the week with their biggest losses in 2023. The S&P 500 was down 2.7%, marking its worst week since Dec. 9. The Dow fell almost 3.0% this week ‚Äî its fourth straight losing week. The Nasdaq closed 3.3% lower, notching its second negative week in three.
*****
> Boeing shares slipped more than 4% after the company temporarily halted delivery of its 787 Dreamliners over a fuselage issue. Shares of Microsoft and Home Depot fell 2.2% and 0.9%, respectively.
*****
> The core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed‚Äôs preferred measurement of inflation, rose 0.6% in January and 4.7% from the prior year, coming in above economists‚Äô expectations.
*****
> The report added to worries that the Fed may have to keep rates higher for longer to quell inflationary pressures.
*****
> Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, believes there is more to the market‚Äôs downturn besides the PCE numbers.
*****
> ‚ÄúAnother reason why the market is having trouble to some degree, I think, is not just about inflation being hotter or concerns that the Fed has to stay tighter for longer,‚Äù Sonders said on Friday.
*****
> ‚ÄúBut there was just a lot of speculation that kicked back in ‚Äîspeculative froth. And the market tends to move in a contrarian fashion when sentiment gets a little too frothy. So I think some of the move has has to do with sentiment. Not just these macro forces,‚Äù she added.
*****
> The strategist believes that inflation cannot come down without a broader economic downturn.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think something would have to give either broadly in the economy, or more specifically in the labor market, to bring the immaculate disappearance of inflation,‚Äù Sonders said. ‚ÄúWithout that commensurate hit to the economy or the labor market, I think it‚Äôs a stretch.‚Äù

> # Mixed Signals

> There's a ton of debate over whether or not the S&P 500's 2022 closing low in October marked the start of a new bull market (20%+ rally on a closing basis without a 20% decline in between) or was just a pause in what is likely to be another leg lower. From the bear's perspective, the tepidness of the rally off those October lows stands out. Already more than four months past those lows, the S&P 500 is only up 10.8%, and its maximum gain was 16.9%. It's often said, that bottoms tend to be so short-lived that the market gives investors a narrow window to get in near the lows, but here we are 135 days removed from that October low, and the S&P 500 still hasn't reached the 20% threshold for a bull market. To put that in perspective, to find a bull market where it took the S&P 500 longer to reach the 20% bull market threshold, you have to go back to 1962; the ten bull markets between then and now all reached the 20% point faster and the average number of days that elapsed from the closing low to 20% was 57 days.

> Although the market's rally off the October lows has been relatively muted, sector leadership since those lows has hardly been led by defensive sectors. As shown in the chart below, Utilities, Consumer Staples, and Health Care are all up since those October lows, but all three are also underperforming the S&P 500. Meanwhile, cyclical sectors like Materials, Industrials, Financials, and Technology are all handily outperforming the S&P 500. In addition, despite all the concern about higher rates, the Real Estate sector has still managed to outperform.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/022423-Sectors-Since-October.png))**

> Looking more recently at sector performance YTD, it's a similar trend. Consumer Discretionary, Technology, and Communication Services have all outperformed the S&P 500 by a factor of at least 2x while defensive-oriented sectors are not only underperforming the market, but they're also down YTD. The market may not exactly be following the bull market playbook, but sector leadership isn't following a recessionary playbook either.

> # Can the US Manage Its Debt?

> The US national debt is about $31 trillion right now, which is equivalent to about 120% of GDP (as of the third quarter of 2022). Massive, but also note that this is down from a peak of 135% in the second quarter of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-2023-02-23-Fed-govt-debt-to-GDP-1226x1600.png))**

> As a point of clarification, the US government typically racks up a deficit each year: which is the amount by which spending exceeds revenues. And accumulated deficits over time represent the national debt. Here‚Äôs a helpful graphic from the US treasury:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-2023-02-23-deficits-to-debt.png))**

> Here‚Äôs the thing though: looking at debt-to-GDP is sort of like calculating your mortgage balance-to-income ratio. Using the average mortgage debt of $346,000 as of September 2022 and median household income of $71,00, the ‚Äúdebt-to-income‚Äù ratio is just under 500%! There‚Äôs a reason nobody quotes this number. Of course, GDP is not technically the government‚Äôs ‚Äúincome‚Äù ‚Äì only a portion of it is (via taxes).

> Anyway, what really matters is the government‚Äôs (or households‚Äô) ability to service their debt. And interest rates are a key variable there.

> # With rising interest rates, how can the US manage its debt service?
This is a frequent question that we get.

> The short, perhaps glib, answer is Yes. The US can always ‚Äúmanage‚Äù debt service because it prints its own currency. And that‚Äôs a crucial difference to understand between the US government and you and me ‚Äì we can‚Äôt ‚Äúprint money‚Äù to pay off our debt. Or rather, we can print IOUs, but nobody will accept them.

> In all seriousness, US treasuries are considered the safest asset in the world, which includes the belief that the US government will not simply ‚Äúprint money‚Äù to service and pay back its debt. So, let‚Äôs consider the question of whether the US can manage its debt.

> As you can see from the chart below, interest costs for the Federal Government have exploded higher. This is due to rising interest rates as well as the massive increase in debt over 2020-2021.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-2023-02-23-Fed-govt-interest-costs-1201x1600.png))**

> # The other side of the story
The good news is that tax receipts have also exploded higher recently. Of course, rising employment helps a lot ‚Äì there‚Äôs a bit of a round-trip here, with fiscal stimulus helping maintain spending and employment, which in turn is holding up tax revenue. Plus, the stock market has moved up a lot in 2020 and 2021, which means capital gains taxes have also increased.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-2023-02-23-Fed-govt-tax-receipts-1201x1600.png))**

> If you look at interest costs as a percent of tax receipts, things don‚Äôt look as scary. The ratio has risen recently to about 23%, but that‚Äôs well below the historical average of 27% (from 1947 onwards).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-2023-02-23-Fed-govt-interest-as-percent-of-tax-receipts-1214x1600.png))**

> What‚Äôs interesting about the chart is that you can see that the ratio surged in the early 1980s. That‚Äôs because the Volcker interest rate hikes did two things:
> * Raised interest rates

> * Sent the economy into a recession, which meant there were less tax receipts as spending and employment fell

> Interest costs as a percent of tax receipts hit a peak of 52% in 1985. Usually, the concern when government interest costs rise is that it ‚Äúcrowds out‚Äù private investment. Between Q1 1983 and Q2 1985, interest costs as a percent of tax receipts jumped from 43% to 52%. And private nonresidential investment grew 30% during this period.

> This framework also helps us think about what could happen going forward.

> # Looking ahead
> Let‚Äôs consider the numerator first, i.e., tax costs. It looks like the Federal Reserve is close to the end of its interest rate hikes, assuming we don‚Äôt get another upward inflation shock. Now, deficits are projected to remain high over the next decade, around 6% of GDP, but unless we have an economic shock that also prompts a lot more fiscal stimulus, we are unlikely to see the overall level of debt surge higher like it did in 2020.

> With respect to the denominator, i.e., tax receipts, it is ultimately dependent on economic growth since tax receipts are a function of that. As long as GDP rises, the debt-to-GDP ratio should remain stable (or fall), and tax receipts will continue to rise. This is why debt-to-GDP fell from 135% in 2022 to 120% in 2020: rather than debt going down, GDP went up. Nominal GDP rose 12.2% in 2021 and 7.3% in 2022.

> The key for tax receipts to hold up is for the economy to avoid a recession. And that is our base case right now, that there will be no recession.

> So yes, we believe the US debt and interest costs are certainly manageable.

***** 

> # Interest Rate & Recession Fears Suppress Pre-Election Year Bullishness in February

> February‚Äôs strong start was not able to overcome concerns of additional interest rate hikes, recession or generally tepid corporate earnings and guidance. As of today‚Äôs close, all market gains in February have been lost and then some. DJIA is off 2.81%, S&P 500 is down 1.94%, NASDAQ has shed 0.80% and Russell 2000 is 2.26% lower. Like recent Februarys the market did rally ahead of mid-month, but now also appears to be weakening in typical fashion in the back half of the month. Historical trends suggest weakness could persist through the end of the month with just a brief bounce possible later this week.

stocks,11e1rc4,Rivian Q4 Earnings,"Rivian‚Äôs earnings announcement after the bell should be interesting. Although Q4 and FY22 results will be important, investors are already aware that the company missed its production target for 2022, potentially placing added significance on the forward guidance.

$RIVN has moved steadily lower since its late 2021 IPO, which isn‚Äôt all that surprising given the broader market conditions and bearish sentiment toward speculative stocks. The stock currently hovers just above its all-time low, and if the EV maker uses their earnings call to express concerns about output or demand, it would likely result in a retest of the lows.

However, if Rivian can show signs that they are overcoming the supply chain issues cited last quarter and have the potential to increase and hit production targets for 2023, it could provide a catalyst to fuel the stock higher and possibly target a break above the downtrend resistance, which stems back to April.

All trading involves risk, but it should be worth keeping tabs on Rivian‚Äôs earnings and how the market reacts.",City_Index,27,1677576224.0

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

# **Dow closes more than 100 points higher on Friday, but notches third straight week of losses on rate fears: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/16/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
> U.S. stocks were mixed on Friday as stubbornly high inflation and a rebound in rates continued to weigh on investor sentiment.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 129.84 points, or 0.39% to end at 33,826.69. The 30-stock index rallied from lows of the day boosted by shares of Amgen and United Health, which gained 2.69% and 2.41% respectively.
*****
> The S&P 500 shed 0.28% to end the day at 4,079.09, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.58% to close at 11,787.27. Energy was the biggest laggard. Devon Energy dropped 4.29%, dragging down the S&P 500.
*****
> Stocks are mixed on the week. The Dow ended down 0.13% for the week, its third negative week in a row ‚Äî a first since September. The S&P 500 has shed 0.28% for the week, its second negative week in a row. The Nasdaq rose 0.59% on the week.
*****
> Investors continue to worry about how the economy and equities will hold up as the Federal Reserve hikes rates to tame stubbornly high inflation. In a Friday speech, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said there‚Äôs a long way to go before the central bank reaches its target of 2% inflation.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe have been in a very contentious tug of war between the equity markets and the Treasury markets,‚Äù said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley. While Treasurys are signaling that the Fed is going to hold rates higher for longer, equities are not listening and instead looking for a soft landing.
*****
> ‚ÄúEquity investors seem to be looking through a couple more rate hikes and looking forward to a pause,‚Äù he added.
*****
> The moves came after major averages shed more than 1% on Thursday, after the Labor Department said the producer price index ‚Äî an inflation metric that tracks wholesale prices ‚Äî rose 0.7% last month. That was more than economists expected.
*****
> Next week, investors will continue to watch earnings season for signs of consumer strength or weakness. Home Depot, Walmart and Etsy are scheduled to report results next week.

> # The Valentine‚Äôs Day Indicator Sees Green In 2023

> First things first, this is a three-day weekend for many of us and I hope everyone enjoys the long President‚Äôs Day weekend. And if you need to buy a mattress, this is your Super Bowl weekend, good luck out there. Speaking of the Super Bowl, this is our yearly reminder that someone should run for President, and their whole platform should be to make sure that the Super Bowl is always over President‚Äôs Day weekend. Who wouldn‚Äôt want the day after the big game off? I swear they‚Äôd win ‚Ä¶. But I digress.

> We‚Äôve noted many times this year some of the rare yet bullish developments taking place for stocks that should continue to lead to strong performance in 2023. For example, we discussed why the strong January, amid a negative year the year before, could be a very good thing in The Trifecta of Bullish. Here‚Äôs one of the tables from that blog. Higher nine for nine and up 27% for the year would make many bulls smile.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-140.png))**

> Let‚Äôs take another look at the strong start to 2023, but this time wrap in Valentine‚Äôs Day. I hope everyone had a nice Valentine‚Äôs Day earlier this week. Mine was a winner, as my wife got me a Reese‚Äôs Take 5 candy bar, my favorite for sure. Do you know who also had a nice Valentine‚Äôs Day? The bulls. I know, I know, Valentine‚Äôs Day is known for red; well, the Valentine‚Äôs Day Indicator is flashing green.

> 2023 was the 11th-best start to a year ever for the S&P 500 as of Valentine‚Äôs Day, up a very impressive 7.7%. What happened next, looking at the best ten starts to a year? Nine out of 10 times the rest of the year was green, with an average return of nearly 11% and a median return of 12.5% ‚Äì both well above the average returns. Momentum can be a wonderful thing for investors, and the Valentine‚Äôs Day Indicator does little to change that.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-271.png))**

> Speaking of momentum, here‚Äôs an interesting study I did when stocks gained more than 5% during a month (like what happened in January). A year later? Stocks are up 13.5% on average and higher 83% of the time, way better than average. I also broke it up by which month the big gains took place. When January gained more than 5%, the next twelve months are up 12.8% on average and higher 83.3% of the time. Maybe we should be rooting for a 5% gain in May or June, as stocks have never been lower a year later. Or maybe in September, when they gained an incredible 20% on average a year later?

> I will leave you with this. February historically isn‚Äôt a very strong month for stocks, and it is the second half of February when trouble tends to arrive. We are still quite optimistic about how well stocks could do the rest of 2023, but it won‚Äôt be a straight line. Just be aware that the next three or four weeks historically aren‚Äôt very strong, and some well-deserved seasonal weakness could be perfectly normal and healthy.

>  # Up 7 of Last 11 After Presidents‚Äô Day But Still Weak Long Term

> DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ are all up 7 of the last 11 years on the day after the Presidents‚Äô Day market holiday with average changes ranging from -0.12% for DJIA to 0.24% for NASDAQ. In our February 2023 Strategy Calendar for members shows conflicting indications for this Tuesday, February 21, the day after Presidents‚Äô Day. Over the most recent 21-year history this 15th trading of February has been down 61.9% of the time for S&P 500 with average loss of -0.29% earning the day our ‚ÄúAngry Bear‚Äù icon.

> Earlier this week noted the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents‚Äô Day weekend. As you can see in the table here the days after has improved the past 11 years but the Wednesday after has not enjoyed the same turnaround and both days still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents‚Äô Day has been strongest for the S&P 500 with 18 gains and 15 losses for median gain of 0.09% but with an average loss of ‚Äì0.24%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 20 of 33 years with an average loss of ‚Äì0.51% and a median loss of ‚Äì0.30%.

> Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&P 500 have more losses, but DJIA is a loser as well. On the Wednesday after the Presidents‚Äô Day holiday DJIA is down 17 of 33 with an average loss of ‚Äì0.10% and a median decline of ‚Äì0.10%. S&P 500 is down 20 of 33, average ‚Äì0.08%, median ‚Äì0.10% and NASDAQ is down 19 of 33, average ‚Äì0.11%, median ‚Äì0.18%.

> Big losses two days just before and after President‚Äôs Day 2022 fueled by the escalation of belligerent rhetoric and military buildups right before Russia invaded Ukraine have worsened the record. Prior to the invasion the market was already dropping in the face of hot inflation and expectations of coming aggressive Fed rate hikes.

> # American Consumers: Have Money, Will Spend

> ‚ÄúAmerican Consumers: Have money, will spend‚Äú

> That, in a nutshell, is the story of the economy right now.

> Retail sales and food services surged 3% in January, making a mockery of expectations for a 1.7% gain. This is the largest monthly increase since March 2021, but that came on the back of stimulus checks. So excluding the 2020/2021 recovery period (when we saw large drops and gains), you have to go back to October 2001 to find a month with larger gains. And even that was a rebound after a depressed September.

> Such a large number should immediately get your antennae up, and there certainly are seasonality issues. For three years, we‚Äôve seen retail sales drop in December only to surge in January.

> # But don‚Äôt miss the big picture: consumption is running strong
Vehicle sales were the big driver, accounting for over a third of the overall gain. But there was broad strength everywhere, including general merchandise stores, e-commerce, clothing stores, and even furnishings (despite the slowdown in housing activity).

> Spending at restaurants and bars rose by a whopping 7.2%, and it wasn‚Äôt because of prices (up 0.6% last month).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-2023-02-16-retail-sales-breadown.png))**

> ‚ÄúReal‚Äù retail sales and food services, i.e., after adjusting for inflation, rose 2.4% in January. It‚Äôs currently running 9% above the pre-pandemic trend. Make all the seasonality-related adjustments you want‚Äîno denying that consumption is strong. The only surprise really is how strong goods consumption is running, even as we get further away from the pandemic. The expectation was that consumption patterns would normalize by now, and goods spending would head back towards trend.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-2023-02-16-real-income-growth-1168x1600.png))**

> # Consumption is strong because real incomes are rising
It really doesn‚Äôt get much simpler than that.

> January is a great example. Aggregate weekly payrolls, which should give you a sense of income earned by private workers across the economy, rose 1.5% in January. This was on the back of:

> Rising employment (remember the massive jobs report?)
> * More hours worked
> * Strong wage growth

> Meanwhile, inflation was up ‚Äúonly‚Äù 0.5%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-2023-02-16-weekly-payroll-growth-vs-inflation-1169x1600.png))**

> After adjusting for prices, aggregate payrolls have now been rising since last June at an annualized pace of almost 5%. For perspective, this measure of aggregate income ran at an annual pace of just over 2% before the pandemic.

> The current pace is hot, to put it mildly, so don‚Äôt be surprised if we get a pullback. But if employment continues to rise, wage growth remains strong, and inflation doesn‚Äôt surge, real incomes should continue trending higher. And that‚Äôs a tailwind for consumption and the economy.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-2023-02-16-real-sales-1200x1600.png))**

> Of course, the other side of solid consumption is that many of the categories where we see strong consumer spending are seeing upward price pressures. I wrote about this after the January inflation report was released ‚Äì the fact that inflation is running hot in several service sectors and core goods like apparel and furnishings is another indication that demand is strong, especially in those areas.


> # Good news is good news, finally
Hot inflation in the service sector is precisely what the Federal Reserve is worried about. So, it isn‚Äôt a surprise that markets have repriced their expectations for monetary policy, now taking the Fed at their word that they‚Äôll get to the 5.0-5.25% range for the federal funds rate. And stay there for longer.

> That repricing is not great for bonds, but unlike last year, the good news is that stocks have held up quite strong in the face of that. This is positive in that good news about the economy is good news for stocks.

***** 

> # Bulls Step Back

> The S&P 500 hasn't moved decisively in any direction over the past week, and as a result, sentiment saw little change. 34.1% of respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish this week, down from a high of 37.5% last week.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021623-AAII-1.png))**

> Bearish sentiment took from those bullish losses as the reading rose up to 28.8% from 25%. Even though that is a higher reading, it is still the only other reading below 30% since last March.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021623-AAII-2.png))**

> Additionally, the pickup in bearish sentiment was not enough to make bears outnumber bulls. As such, the bull-bear spread saw its first back-to-back positive readings since November 2021.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021623-AAII-3.png))**

> Although over a third of respondents reported as bullish, this week's predominant sentiment level was neutral. 37.1% reported as such this week. That reading has now been above its historical average of 31.4% for seven straight weeks; the longest streak since January 2021.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021623-AAII-4.png))**

> Other sentiment surveys have likewise taken more optimistic tones lately despite a modest pullback in bullish sentiment this week. Factoring in the Investors Intelligence and NAAIM sentiment readings, our sentiment composite remains positive but is off from its short-term peak last week.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021623-AAII-5.png))**

> # Claims Still Below 200K

> Jobless claims continue to impress in the new year. For the fifth week in a row, seasonally adjusted initial claims have come in with a sub-200K reading. That is the longest streak since a 10 week long stretch ending in April of last year. Although claims have remained at a healthy level, there hasn't been much in the way of improvement over the last few weeks with claims yet to move below the 183K low at the end of January.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021623-Claims-1.png))**

> On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, the first few months of the year tends to see a sharp unwind in claims, albeit with some moderation during the current week of the year which is being observed currently with fairly flat readings in claims over the past few weeks. At current levels, this year's reading was roughly in line with the comparable week of the past several years with the exception of the much more elevated reading in 2021.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021623-Claims-2.png))**

> While not to say the reading is at unhealthy levels, continuing claims have not been as strong as initial claims. Claims have risen in each of the past two weeks, totaling 1.696 million in the most recent print. That is the highest level since the week of December 24th. Overall, both initial and continuing claims continue to show healthy readings without much in the way of rapid improvement or deterioration.

> # NFIB Nuances

> This morning's release of the NFIB's survey of small business sentiment showed only a modest rebound. Whereas the index was expected to rise from 89.8 up to 91, the index only rose to 90.3. Albeit higher sequentially and off the lows from last fall, the January reading also remains below the worst levels from the onset of COVID.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-1.png))**

> In addition to optimism remaining weak, the most recent month also saw a surge in economic policy uncertainty. Rising 5 points month over month to 76, that index is at the highest level since July 2021 and saw its biggest one month jump since last July.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-2.png))**

> Looking across the individual components of the report, breadth was mixed with six of the ten inputs into the headline optimism number moving higher while the other four fell. Multiple categories‚Äîin addition to the headline index‚Äîare in the bottom decile of their historical ranges. As we discussed in today's Morning Lineup, while in aggregate some aspects of the report remain weak, there is some nuance. In general, this month's report saw improvement in categories measuring realized changes (i.e. actual earnings changes, actual sales changes, actual employment changes, etc.) while expectations were much worse (i.e. plans to make capital outlays, plans to increase inventories, etc.). In other words, small businesses appear to have pessimistic outlooks contrary to reporting actual improvements in their businesses.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-3.png))**

> The employment situation showcases that divergence between actual changes and plans. Hiring plans remain at the low end of the pandemic range even after a slight rebound versus the December reading. Meanwhile, compensation plans have plummeted to a new low and the weakest level since April 2021. That was in spite of actual employment changes showing net hirings at the highest level since March 2020 with a coincident uptick in compensation to the highest level in six months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-4.png))**

> Albeit on net more firms are seeing declines rather than increases, this month also saw an improvement in actual sales and earnings. Part of that change is likely thanks to alleviation in inflation as the higher prices index hit a new post-high low of 42. In turn, the percentage of respondents reporting now as a good time to expand has modestly recovered. With that said, sales expectations continued to reverse lower after peaking two months ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-5.png))**

> As for expenditure indices, again the dichotomy of plans and actual changes is apparent. While plans experienced a 13th percentile month over month decline to the low end of its pandemic range, reported capital expenditures have surged with a top decile month over month reading. In fact, that sharp rise during the month of January resulted in the joint highest reading of the post pandemic period (March and May 2021 saw identical readings).

> Meanwhile, plans to increase inventories are rapidly declining. The index for inventory accumulation has now reached the lowest level since 2009. However, even though inventories are rapidly declining, businesses on net report satisfaction with current inventory levels. Following the very high readings in inventory satisfaction earlier in the pandemic (meaning on net a higher percentage of respondents reported inventories were too low), the huge drop in inventory accumulation would indicate some supply/demand mismatches are working themselves out; likely in part thanks to weakening sales.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-6.png))**

> Turning back to capital expenditures, the NFIB also surveys on what these small businesses are spending their money on. January saw a broad uptick across categories with the exception of furniture or fixtures.

I'm planning to reduce the percentage of individual stocks holdings in my portfolio once the time is right as my exposure to them is bigger than I'd like (beginner's mistakes plus Bogle influence).

The final decision will be made by me of course, just would like to know opinions of others about this, if you had to pick, which one of these companies would you keep? And why? Pros and cons in your opnion? Let me know your thoughts, will be thankful!

stocks,11nb7ru,"ULTA Stock Drops Late, Despite Big Beat; Revenue Tops $10 Billion"," **Ulta Beauty** comfortably beat expectations for its fourth-quarter report late Thursday. ULTA stock slumped after hours Thursday on a lower-than-expected comparable sales guidance.

Any change in strategy this year?0 of 9 minutes, 4 secondsVolume 0% 

The Bolingbrook, Ill.-based Ulta Beauty operates 1,355 stores across the U.S. Ulta's earnings and revenue have grown for the past seven consecutive quarters. Over the last four quarters leading up to Thursday's report, Ulta averaged 43% earnings growth and roughly 20% revenue growth, respectively.

On Wednesday, Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai noted that the beauty category's momentum carried into February, although at a slightly moderated pace. Industry and competitor data indicate a same-store sale upside for Ulta for Q4, with mi-teen comparable sales growth implied, Katai wrote.

Last month, competitor **ELF Beauty** blew away quarterly earnings as adjusted earnings doubled to 48 cents per share. ELF shares are up 32% since its report.

## Earnings Results

Ulta adjusted earnings spiked 23.5% to $6.68 per share as revenue jumped 18.2% to $3.22 billion.

For the fourth quarter, Wall Street expected Ulta adjusted earnings to rise 4.6% to $5.66 per share on roughly 11% revenue growth to $3.03 billion.

Comparable sales climbed 15.6%, compared to 21.4% growth during Q4 last year. The FactSet consensus guided for an 8.7% comparable sales increase.

Full-year sales surged 18.2% to $10.2 billion and net sales leapt 26% to $1.2 billion, both records for the company.

""As we move into fiscal 2023, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category, and I am excited about the opportunities ahead,"" CEO Dave Kimbell said in the release.

For fiscal 2023, Ulta forecasts diluted earnings to range from $24.70 to $25.40 per share on $10.95 billion to $11.05 billion in sales. The guidance is fairly higher than the FactSet consensus of $23.07 earnings per share on $10.15 billion in revenue.

The Federal Reserve will be releasing an updated dot plot (a chart that shows the projections of individual members of the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) for the federal funds rate) March 22nd. We're looking at a 75%/25% split in estimations (FedWatch futures) between a .25bps and .50bps hike.

The terminal rate will most likely be in the range of 5.20% - 5.25% They are estimated to reach this terminal rate either by the March meeting, or the May meeting. Unless I am wrong?

https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html

At the moment, from what I can tell, anything above 5.25% is not priced in. aka, if in the June/July/September/November/December meetings, if inflation reading continue to come in hot and the Fed is continued to have its hand forced to continue to raise rates, the market will most likely have a negative reaction.

What would it take for the March 22nd meeting to bring good news that sends the markets rocketing? The current narrative seems that we weren't able to hold recent $415+ highs and many people are profit-taking under the guise of ""the recession hasn't started yet/the impacts of rate hikes haven't begun to have been felt/tech layoffs are just in their first wave. This should bring us back to at least $390, and potentially start the next leg down.",waltwhitman83,20,1677000246.0

stocks,113swrm,DDOG: Why would a company consistently sandbag guidance?,"So DDOG reported earnings this morning.  On initial report stock dropped 10% on what I assume was weak guidance(Forecasting Q1'23 would be flat to Q4'22).  And lower than expected guidance for FY 2023.  The problem is, they always do this.  I started researching this after it dropped 10%, it seems to have rebounded a fair bit as of typing this post, but wanted to share results anyway.

&#x200B;

Columns:

**Revenue:** (reported from ER)

&#x200B;

**Guidance:** from previous quarter ER (I took the midpoint of their range.  The ranges are small though, mostly 2-5 Million)

&#x200B;

**AS of:** is the date the guidance for that quarter was given(from previous ER; the language is literally 'Guidance as of XXXX date')

&#x200B;

**% Quarter Completed**:  Reflects how much of the quarter was done by the as of date

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|ER Quarter|Revenue (Actual)|Guidance (From PrevQ)|As Of|% Quarter Completed|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Q1'21|198.5|186|2/11/21|54%|
|Q2'21|233.5|212|5/6/21|61%|

|Q4'22|469.4|447|11/3/22|65%|

&#x200B;

And for a comparison as to how bad/consistent their guidance is off

&#x200B;

Forecasted QoQ is just guidance/actuals; both data points are from the same ER(so Q2'22 guidance/Q1'21 actuals from same ER)

&#x200B;

|ER Quarter|Actual QoQ Growth|Forecasted QoQ Growth|Miss %|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|Q2'22|12%|4%|\-7.3%|
|Q3'22|7%|1%|\-6.9%|
|Q4'22|8%|2%|\-5.6%|

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My questions is, is there a reason for this?  With so much stock swings at ER being because of guidance, why would a company consistently forecast below.  Is it incompetence on the part of the team doing the forecasting?  Are they trying to keep their share price low to hamper stock options among employees in the firm?  Especially since they are a growth stock.  Is it simply, lower guidance = easier to beat?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Amazon-owned autonomous vehicle venture Zoox said on Monday that it is now testing its self-driving robotaxis on public roads in California with passengers on board.

The vehicles have no steering wheel or pedals, and they have bidirectional driving capabilities and four-wheel steering, enabling them to change directions without the need to reverse.

Zoox executives said the company began the tests after it received approval from the California Department of Motor Vehicles last week.

The permit is not for all public roads in the state. The tests are currently limited to shuttling Zoox employees on a one-mile public route between two office buildings at the company‚Äôs headquarters in Foster City, California, at speeds up to 35 miles an hour. The company hasn‚Äôt said how big its test fleet is, but executives have said they have built ‚Äúdozens‚Äù of vehicles, although fewer than 100.

Zoox said one of its vehicles completed a test run with employees on board over the weekend.

Amazon acquired the 9-year-old startup in 2020 and, at the time, shared few details about how it planned to use the company‚Äôs technology. Zoox unveiled its custom-built, electric robotaxi in 2020, with an eye on offering on-demand autonomous transportation in urban settings.

On a call with reporters, Zoox executives declined to say when the company will launch a commercial robotaxi service or open up testing beyond the limited route and employee participants. It will continue to test the vehicle with employees and expects to launch a shuttle service for staffers this spring.

GM‚Äôs driverless unit, Cruise, has also developed an autonomous shuttle called Origin which does not have manual controls. Cruise and Alphabet‚Äôs Waymo last year received approval to roll out their driverless taxi services in California and charge passengers for the rides.

Unlike Cruise, Zoox says its driverless vehicles ‚Äî which do not have a steering wheel or other manual controls ‚Äî meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, and so the company is not seeking any waiver to put them into use on public roads.

All companies testing their vehicles on public roads in the state of California are required to report every time their system disengages or whenever a human driver has to take over for the autonomous system while driving, usually due to safety concerns or software issues.

Zoox doesn‚Äôt even refer to these incidents as disengagements, but rather as cases where the vehicle needs support or guidance, so does not report them to the state.

‚ÄúIf the vehicle is in a situation where it needs help because either it needs to do something it‚Äôs not normally allowed to do, or because it doesn‚Äôt know how to handle a situation, we have what‚Äôs called a ‚Äòfusion center,‚Äô with trained guidance operators monitoring the output of the scene and then will give guidance to the vehicle and either give it permission to do something ‚Äî but the vehicle is still in charge and does all the driving ‚Äî or drop breadcrumbs on alternative trajectory, or in the worst-case scenario pull over,‚Äù Zoox CEO Aicha Evans told reporters.",Puginator,20,1676319316.0

stocks,118ptcu,Is Walmart sandbagging guidance? Their comparable sales guidance seems unreasonably low and based on 'vibes' about the macro situation.,"Walmart is guiding for 2-2.5% growth in comparable sales in 2023. Assuming inflation will be 3-4% over the course of 2023, achieving just 2-2.5% growth in same-store sales seems like a trivial goal. More broadly, Q4 real GDP growth was 2.9%, and I imagine Q1 real GDP growth will also be somewhat similar (say >2% annualized). So add on a few percentage points to get the nominal figure. You'd expect sales numbers to reflect that nominal level at least. Walmart's most recent quarter's comparable sales growth was 8.3% year over year.

Another Tweet highlighted how their negative guidance had basically little to do with their actual numbers but vague macro doomery.

[Here is a snippet from the earnings call](https://i.imgur.com/xhNIQgP.png).

As the [Tweet author](https://twitter.com/modestproposal1/status/1628150488028815360) said:

> This answer from the WMT CFO re why they guided so conservatively is the doomer trifecta of Fed tightening, excess savings depletion and auto loan DQs. Note he doesn't point to any actual hard data from the hundreds of millions of weekly shoppers or $600B in annual sales.

Walmart has been raising prices on their items, and seem to be keeping up with inflation, while food prices have corrected besides a few anomalies. They point out 'continued strong market share gains in grocery, including high-income households' and 'membership income growth' of 7%.

> ""We're gaining share across income cohorts, including at the higher end which made up nearly half of the gains we saw in the U.S. again this quarter and we're also capturing a greater share of wallet at Sam's Club in the U.S. with both mid- and higher-income shoppers.""

That doesn't seem consistent with 2-2.5% same store sales growth for the next year...

Meanwhile, they're pointing to subprime auto loans turning delinquent, the Fed raising rates, as if... people are going to stop buying their essentials from Walmart? This isn't Whole Foods we're talking about. Walmart is a consumer staple not consumer discretionary. I'd buy those remarks if it was an airline CEO making them.

This sandbagging is part of a trend where it is the CEOs/CFOs on earnings calls who are invoking 'recession' while macro data remains reasonably strong.

* Politics

**Three Important Equilibrium's:**

* Debt growth is in line with income growth that is required to service the debts
* Economic capacity utilization is neither too high nor too low
* Projected returns of equities are above the projected returns of bonds which are above the projected returns of cash by appropriate risk premiums

* Reserve currency status

**Economic and market movements are like a perpetual motion machine of interactions of these nine**

**12** **Investment Principles**

* The theoretical value equals the present value of future cash flows
* The actual value that it will trade at will equal the total amount of spending (if I calculate the total amount of dollars spent on something) divided by the quantity of goods sold

**Context/ DD - This is the looooong winded part**

1. We have this broken down in terms of economic principles and investment principles because the markets follow the economy. To understand the market, you must understand the economy; to do that; you must understand the four major forces, three Important equilibrium, and two levers.
2. The economy and the markets are like a perpetual motion machine of the interaction of the above 4/3/2.
3. Over time, things get better in the quality of our personal lives. We look to increase the quality of our living, individually and as a society - This is called productivity.
4. Productivity is the most important thing, but we don't really see it because it evolves over a more extended period.
5. The big things that we see and feel every day are debt cycles. There is a long-term debt cycle and a short-term debt cycle.
6. By short-term debt cycle, I usually mean the business cycle.
7. For instance, if the economic activity rate is too low in a recession and there is weakness in the economy, the Central Banks (CBs) produce credit.
8. Credit is buying power. CBs produce that credit which creates purchasing power for goods, services, and financial assets - And then, the economy picks up, and that cycle typically lasts seven to ten years.
9. As the economy picks up, the demand rises relative to the capacity. As you get later in the cycle, the CBs hit the brakes, raise interest rates, and tighten monetary policy. The unemployment rate is low because there is less slack in the economy. They put the brakes on it by pulling the lever to increase interest rates. They tighten monetary policy, then you have a recession, slow up, which is the cycle.
10. And because credit is buying power, credit produces debt, and debt means the obligation to pay back.
11. It is crucial to understand that nature is cyclical, first comes the stimulation, then comes the paying back.
12. When you produce credit, you can spend more than you earn.
13. And when you pay back, you have to spend less than you earn.
14. And that is the nature of the cycle. Most of us are aware and acquainted with this cycle.
15. With that cycle comes market cycles. And this is all that I mean by the short-term debt cycle.
16. There is also a longer-term debt cycle, which is an accumulation of all those shorter-term debt cycles.
17. Because everybody wants things to go up, they want their asset prices, the markets, and employment to go up.
18. For that reason, CBs will stimulate the economy, typically lowering interest rates until interest rates hit zero.
19. When interest rates hit zero, they can't do that anymore, which brings us to the need to print money and buy financial assets, which we call quantitative easing (QE). And when CBs can't do QE anymore, or there are limitations imposed, we come to the end of the long-term debt cycle.
20. So now we have covered a short-term debt cycle, a long-term debt cycle, and productivity.
21. Now, related to all of that is politics. There are Internal politics and external politics. And in that normal cycle, they are related.
22. For example, in 2008 and 2009, there was a debt cycle, and interest rates hit zero. And that is very similar to 1929 to 1932. There was a debt crisis, and interest rates hit zero.
23. And in both of those cases, there was a printing of money and buying of financial assets. And this caused those financial asset prices to go up and more economic liquidity. And that particularly benefited those with financial assets and contributed to the wealth and income gap, as did technology.
24. As a result of that, in the 1930s and also now, politics entered the picture, and the wealth gap is causing populism. A populism of the left and populism of the right has an effect on the markets and an impact on the economy.
25. So we are seeing a situation very similar to the 1930s in which we are seeing a rising power challenging an existing power, which is a geopolitical cycle.
26. When a rising power in the form of China is challenging an existing power in the form of the United States, and if we look at the history and cycles of those periods - There is a cycle of conflict and peace.
27. Typically, peace happens after war because some dominant country wins the war, and nobody wants to fight the dominant power, which creates an extended period of peace.
28. And I am not saying we will have a military conflict, although that always exists as a possibility.
29. These cycles have happened over and over again.
30. Politics can affect the cycles. For example, the shift in the United States to create a tax cut helps the corporate tax picture and causes stock prices to rise.
31. Okay, those are all the cycles. Then, we compare it to three equilibriums.
32. First, debt growth must be in line with the income growth required to service the debt.
33. If debt growth is faster than the income growth that will service the debt, we will have an adjustment, and I am always doing a Pro-forma. What is the ability to service that debt? This is the first equilibrium.
34. The second equilibrium is that the economic activity or capacity utilization rate is neither too high nor too low. That means, if you have it pressing up too much or overheating the economy, that will cause a tightening monetary policy and a correction.
35. If you have it too low so that the economy is depressed, and there‚Äôs a lot of slack, that's going to cause an adjustment to bring it up, so always be watching where we are relative to that because that is a key driver of the cycles.
36. The third equilibrium is that the projected returns of equities are above the projected returns of bonds above the projected returns of cash by appropriate risk premiums.
37. In other words, the capital markets produce the circulation of buying power in the form of this credit, and this relationship of the cash to bond yields to stock yields and asset classes determines how money flows through the economy.
38. And for normal condition (for reasons I won't digress into) is to have cash have a lower return than bonds that have a lower return from equities, having to do with how the system works.
39. CBs put cash on deposit, and people with better ideas have to make a profit to use that money to create these other levels of economic activity and have higher returns.
40. When that is not the case, the way they tighten it is through the use of two levers.
41. The two levers are monetary policy and fiscal policy.
42. Monetary policy is how the brakes and gas are put on, and the brakes and the gas being put on become reflected in each of these other items.
43. If debt growth is too high relative to income growth and capacity utilization is high or stretched, CBs will tighten monetary policy.
44. The tightening of monetary policy will change the projected return of cash relative to bonds and those equities, and those risk premiums will slow the economy down.
45. And that will drive those cycles, and that's how the economy operates in this perpetual motion.
46. If you could picture where you are in those cycles and what is happening, you can anticipate what will happen next because it is that perpetual motion machine.
47. That is the template in a nutshell. You must constantly be thinking, where are we now?
48. Here is some hard data for you:
49. When you look at GDP going back to 1900, and again GDP is productivity, there is a significant inevitable force that happens over a period of time. Even the most significant economic turbulence you know, looks like a bump in that cycle. Productivity is a big force; betting on productivity is a big force.
50. As you get later in the long-term debt cycle, what happens is that productivity begins to slow because there needs to be an investment, and there needs to be other things. When there is activity or prosperity, you get more productivity, a self-reinforcing cycle.
51. Suppose you examine charts showing productivity over a certain period in developed countries and China. In that case, you will see in varying degrees that productivity will bend over as they are later in their longer-term cycle‚ÄîUS, China, Japan, etc.
52. Japan is later in that debt cycle, and you see hardly any productivity growth.
53. That is what productivity looks like- Now, where are we in the short-term debt cycle of the business cycle?
54. See Appendix A & B to see what the cycle looks like
55. What happens from the capital markets (stock market) perspective - as you begin to go to higher levels of operating rate and lower levels of unemployment, CBs begin to tighten, liquidity starts to tighten, and risk premiums begin to rise.
56. As of March of 2019, we were nine years into the cycle, unemployment rates are comparatively low, and there is less slack, so it is no surprise that CB tightens monetary policy.
57. The CB tightens monetary policy by either raising interest rates or lowering the purchases of the financial assets they buy by expanding the balance sheet. And that is where we were as of q1 2019.
58. If you look at how markets behave in that part of the cycle, we break cycles into three pieces. The early phase of the cycle, the mid phase of the cycle, and the late phase of the cycle
59. Typically when you are late in the cycle, it coincides with less attractive returns.
60. Interest rates hit their lows and can‚Äôt go lower, so we deal with quantitative easing.
61. If you look at a chart going back to 1900 and examine the debt to GDP ratio to examine how now, it seems like the cycle we went through in the 1930s.
62. In other words, because of the debt crisis and interest rates hitting zero, you had the printing of money, as evidenced by examining the CB balance sheet, the monetary base, and the acceleration of printing money. The same thing happened in the 2008 financial crisis. You can see the debt crisis; you hit zero in interest rates, they are stuck, so they have to print the money, and then we have the reaction.
63. Very similar to 1932 to 1937, as the economy picked up, in 1937, they started to tighten monetary policy because they were worried the economy was overheating and inflation was going to rise, and they caused a recession.
64. That was the first time they used the word recession. It was like re-depression, and they used the term recession, which was the 1938 period.
65. We talked about debt, but there are also unfunded liabilities that we don‚Äôt call debt - which would be pension and health care liabilities. There are a lot of liabilities/promises out there that must be kept.
66. As it relates to both the markets and the economy - we have been in a Golden age of capitalism in the following sense - Profit margins have more than doubled since 2000, meaning that if you didn't have an expansion in profit margin - the stock market would be 40% lower.
67. Profit margins grew because of several factors such as efficiencies gained with technology, globalization creating a larger market share, and companies reducing union membership, which reduced employee compensation and contributed to the growth of the wealth gap.
68. The wealth gap or profit gap has been great for companies, but it has not been great for a certain percentage of the population. If you look at the conditions of the bottom 60% percent of the population, and the bottom 60 means the majority, the conditions have been bad.
69. Since 1980 there has been no real income growth in the United States. In a Fed survey, 40% of all Americans could not raise $400 in the event of an emergency. So there is a gap.
70. The wealth gap is seen by looking at the net worth of the top 1/10th of 1% of the population's net worth, which is almost the same as the bottom 90% combined.
71. As a result, we have populism, populism on the left, and populism on the right. That is a phenomenon that developed countries didn't use to have. Not only is it a political phenomenon but an economic and market phenomenon.
72. Because as we go into the political elections in countries such as the US and throughout Europe, it will be a conflict of capitalism over socialism or the left and the right, and it will become extreme in both cases.
73. And as these profit margins improved and corporate tax rates have gone down, you also have cheap money used to buy back stock or make mergers which also helps boost stock prices.
74. Many of these items will not continue. In Q1 of 2019, this model predicted that profit margins would go down, and you were at the best of the corporate tax rates, so that likely won't go much lower.
75. This all means that we are entering a new environment that will not be as conducive to purchasing financial assets by the CB. Simply put, we are going from tailwinds to headwinds.
76. To give you a flavor of what this political situation is like and the polarity and the entrenchedness - you can look at charts going back to 1900, which show how conservative the republicans are through a survey to examine economically conservative. And as of 2019 - they are more conservative than ever.
77. You can look at another chart back to 1900 examining how liberal democrats are in policy, and they are also more liberal than ever.
78. This means both parties have not had greater polarity than we have today.
79. Suppose you include the votes cast along party lines in each chart. In other words, republicans are sticking with republicans, and democrats are sticking with democrats. In that case, it easily depicts the entrenched conflict we are having in the US.
80. The political polarity is not just taking place in the US but also in Europe. It was expected that Jeremy Corbyn would remain in power in the UK, which would impact capital flows.
81. But France elected Macron, and the UK elected Boris Johnson. Boris is center-right, and Macron is socially and economically left.
82. So we are relatively late in the cycle and entering a period where CBs have less power than they used to ease in conjunction with populism in election cycles.
83. You can judge the capacity of a country to ease by looking at the level of interest rates relative to zero, the amount of quantitative easing that can take place, and its marginal effects.
84. For example, in the US - you go from 2.5% to zero, then you are done.
85. But in Europe, there are limitations, caps at 33% of certain types of debt that they can‚Äôt go beyond unless there is some type of agreement politically, which is very difficult to agree on anything. So there is going to be a problem for the European Central Bank ECB to have the ability to stimulate.
86. Japan was somewhat similar when they had slightly negative interest rates, reducing the ability to stimulate.
87. So that is the lay of the land with markets and the economy with the 4/3/2.
88. Moving on to the rising power challenging the existing power - China will be an important influence in the world we are operating in for the rest of our lifetimes. And China will become an increasing influence in globalization and so on.
89. When you examine the relative output of China and the US and what is likely in terms of equity market cap and share of debt securities outstanding, you will see the strength of these powers.
90. In other words, the Chinese/Asian markets are becoming more prominent, liquid, and effective. These markets will play an important role, as will the Chinese economy in our environment, not only in the form of trade but also in the form of geopolitical impacts, mainly reflected in technology.
91. If you look at history and what caused countries to succeed and fail, it was mainly driven by technology.
92. When you examine the rise and decline of world reserve currencies, first, to do that, you first have to examine the arc of each of these currencies.
93. There is the US dollar; before that, you had the British pound, and before that, you had the Dutch Guilder. And as a result of that, you need to understand several things about the economies that made them a reserve currency in the first place. How did they become reserve currencies, and how did they lose their reserve currency status? This means we must watch several factors, statistics, numbers, and indices.
94. So we get down to the six main factors you can judge a country's power by:
95. innovation, meaning technology, education, and competitiveness
96. Economic output
97. Share of world trade
98. Military strength
99. Financial center strength
100. Reserve currency status
101. Power is a vague thing, and you can have economic power, you can have military power, and you can have power in different ways.
102. We will examine these factors over four cases, the Dutch cycle, the British cycle, the US cycle, and the Chinese cycle.
103. In examining these cycles, the first is innovation, meaning technology, education, and competitiveness. Mostly a new technology, like the 5G technology, and the issues pertained to Huawei and other technology companies.
104. If you have the technology, it works both economically and militarily. And in the case of the Dutch, it was the ability to build ships that could go anywhere worldwide. And they took those ships, and because the Europeans were experts in fighting, they always fought with each other - They took the guns, put them on the boats, went out to the rest of the world, and accounted for half of the world trade.
105. And when they go out there with half of the world trade, they bring their money, the Dutch Guilder, and when they bring the money, it becomes a world reserve currency.
106. To go out into the world, they must have a military to support that.
107. And so these cycles go on, and if you were to look at a chart to exemplify this with the US being blue and China as red, going back to 1500 and averaging these things, what you would see is the Chinese have typically been number one or number two.
108. Although the world was a different size, those were all very far away places, compared to the way we live now, where it is all one sort of world.
109. And this will conclude the economic principles; as of 2017, we were relatively late in the business cycle, metaphorically the 7th inning.
110. There is a relative tightening of the business policy and monetary policy; we have less economic capacity, greater polarity, and a situation where we will have political issues, and those political issues will be market issues.
111. Because as we start to think - will this be a movement to the right or the left - that will impact capital flows.
112. Now we will transition to the list of Investment principles (Appendix C)
113. First is #1. - The theoretical value equals the present value of future cash flows.
114. In other words, every investment is a lump sum payment for a future cash flow.
115. So when we think about what is something worth, we look at those projected cash flows, and we discount them with an interest rate to arrive at the theoretical value.
116. The actual value that it will trade is listed in Investment Principle #2
117. 2. - The actual value that it will trade at will equal the total amount of spending (if I calculate the total amount of dollars spent on something) divided by the quantity of goods sold.
118. So we should always be looking at how much will be spent, what are the spenders' motivations and determine the quantity.
119. In short, we estimate the total spending divided by the quantity to estimate the price.
120. And #3. - Asset classes will outperform cash over the long term.
121. This is required; otherwise, the economy's gears come to a screeching halt.
122. And #4. - The out performance of asset classes over cash (i.e., beta) cannot be very positive for too long.
123. Because if it were, it would be easy; if it were positive, you would borrow cash, buy the long things and make a lot of money.
124. It comes with big bumps along the way.
125. This brings us to #5. - Assets are priced to discount future expectations. So when inflation, growth, risk premiums, and discount rates.
126. And #6. - Every investment is a return stream.
127. What I mean by that is every day, you can mark it to the market, and you know what it‚Äôs like, so the key is to put together portfolios of return streams so that they balance well.
128. Dalio says that whatever success he has or Bridgewater has experienced has to do with knowing how to deal with their not knowing more than anything they know. This is because what you don‚Äôt know is a lot, and you can reduce your risk a lot more than you will reduce your return by knowing how to diversify well.
129. This is Investment principle #7. - Diversification can reduce risk more than it reduces returns, so it improves return-to risk ratio
130. And then, we need to get to the next one, which deals with understanding that there are two types of return streams #8. Return streams can be either betas or alpha.
131. What I mean by a beta return stream is that there is an intrinsic reason that that asset class will behave in a certain way that you will know.
132. In other words, if growth rises faster than discounted and interest rates don‚Äôt rise much, you know that stocks will go up.
133. So there is an environmental so you can structure that.
134. Alpha is a zero-sum game; in other words, for me to produce alpha, I have to outperform and take money away from somebody else. This is zero-sum, like a game of poker.
135. And again, #9. - The key to good investing is to create good portfolios of good return streams.
136. And to balance them, you have to risk balance them, which is #10. - Return streams can be risk-adjusted to be risk balanced.
137. In other words, somebody might think that if I put 50% of my dollars in stocks and 50% of my dollars in bonds, I am diversified, but that is not true because the volatility of stocks is twice the volatility of bonds. And because of that, you have to risk balance them.
138. And then #11. - The holy grail of investing is finding 15 or more good uncorrelated return streams
139. And lastly, systematizing decision rules is critical - #12. - Systematize decision-making; rules should be timeless and universal.
140. What I mean by that is - we should write down the criteria for investing, and then we take those criteria and test them through all periods of time and all countries, timeless and universal.
141. Because if something happened at one time and your process is not working at that time, then it must be that you haven‚Äôt explained the differences.
142. And so, by forcing ourselves to try to make those rules timeless and universal, it becomes the standard that we operate by. So all rules that you operate by should be timeless and universal.
143. 35:31
144. If we were to pass through some charts, for example going back to 1975, and you would think of this chart as the ‚Äúrolling returns of asset classes,‚Äù you would be able to see that all asset classes have good times and times that are bad.
145. And on average, they are above zero, but they all have down periods.
146. And inevitably, what happens is that most investors love the asset classes that did well. The biggest mistake of most investors is that they think the investment that did well is a good investment rather than thinking of it as a more expensive investment.
147. So you can break the drivers of asset class returns into a few categories, which is true for all asset classes - two main things drive it: inflation and growth.
148. \*\*\*Basically, if you tell me that inflation is going to be higher than expected and growth be higher than expected, then I would know what to invest in, \*\*\*higher than discounted. Not sure if he messed up on 37:08 when he said ""higher than expected and higher than discounted.""
149. But if we knew that, we would all know what to invest in.
150. So those become the two main drivers; they can rise or decline.
151. And then, there are discount rates and risk premiums (sometimes written as risk premia).
152. Discount rates mean the interest rate impacts all asset classes because the interest rate is the discount rate you use to compare the cash flows.
153. \*So if you raise the interest rate that is negative for all asset classes, and then you have, when you strip all that risk premium out, that equals the following.
154. A chart that shows what happened in history in relation to that context.
155. As an example, a chart would show growth assets relative to assets that you would hold if you had a falling growth environment and assets that you would hold if you had a rising growth environment and the same with inflation, and then add what the discount rate is and then also looking at the risk premium which would be the residual of that, and that's what we have an all-weather return. An all-weather return is an optimally diversified portfolio.
156. And if you were to examine the data on diversification, you would see that diversification can substantially improve your risk-to-return ratio.
157. Turning to a chart that would show the holy grail of investing.
158. The X-axis shows the ""number of assets/alphas in the portfolio"" from 1-20, and Y-axis shows the ""annual portfolio standard deviation.""
159. And if you can do what this chart depicts, you will make a fortune and be very successful, and it is simple but not easy.
160. The concept is that if you can get 5,10,15,20 good uncorrelated investments, you can substantially improve the return to risk ratio.
161. The chart illustrates that diversification is more important than good, even in picking the best investments.
162. Most people think, give me the best investment and let me put all my money in what I think is the best investment, but that is wrong.
163. The goal is to find your best ten uncorrelated investments and put your money in that, and you will do a lot better.
164. So again, if you look at that chart, and the y-axis, the standard deviation, let's call that risk, of 10%, and imagine, I invest in an asset that has 10% return and 10% standard deviation and let's say I put in a second investment that is 60% correlated with that, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and so on, you can see how the risk in your portfolio would significantly be reduced.
165. This means if you have a diversified portfolio of stocks. FYI the average stock is about 60% correlated with average other stocks. You can put in 100 investments; you can put in 1,000 investments - you are not going to materially reduce your risk relative to just putting in 5 - 10, which will reduce your risk by 10 to 15% if you have an uncorrelated return stream. You can get actually get better than uncorrelated because you can have negatively correlated, but let's say I put in an uncorrelated return stream; you would see what the chart would show. For example, you more than cut your risk in half at five uncorrelated return streams. If you go to 15 uncorrelated return streams, you will reduce your risk by nearly 80%.
166. This means you have improved your return to risk ratio by a factor of 5.
167. To recap, you can reduce your risk significantly without reducing your return, which is the key to it.
168. So when I look at this, I think there are two types of assets; what's your strategic asset allocation mix? What is your beta? In other words, what portfolio do you usually have? In my opinion, it should be highly diversified, but along those lines in terms of something like half in growth, half in inflation rising and declining. Then alphas, you have to have a lot of different alpha. In the case of Bridgewater, there are over 100 different types of alphas and about 130 different kinds of markets in terms of trading.

**TLDR: 4 / 3 / 2 / 6 / 12**

**Economic Principles 4/3/2**

**Four Big Forces:**

* Productivity
* The short-term debt cycle
* The long-term debt cycle
* Politics

**Three Important Equilibrium's:**

* Debt growth is in line with income growth that is required to service the debts
* Economic capacity utilization is neither too high nor too low
* Projected returns of equities are above the projected returns of bonds which are above the projected returns of cash by appropriate risk premiums

**Two Levers:**

* Monetary Policy
* Fiscal Policy

**Six main Factors to Judge a Country‚Äôs Power By**:

* Innovation, meaning technology, education, and competitiveness
* Economic output
* Share of world trade
* Military strength
* Financial center strength
* Reserve currency status

**Economic and market movements are like a perpetual motion machine of interactions of these nine**

**Twelve Investment Principles**

1. The theoretical value equals the present value of future cash flows

* 2. The actual value that it will trade at will equal the total amount of spending (if I calculate the total amount of dollars spent on something) divided by the quantity of goods sold
* 3. Asset classes will outperform cash over the long term
* 4. The out performance of asset classes over cash (i.e. beta cannot be very positive for too long
* 5. Assets are priced to discount future expectations. So when inflation, growth, risk premiums and discount rates
* 6. Every investment is a return stream
* 7. Diversification can reduce risk more than it reduces returns so it improves return-to risk ratio
* 8. Return streams can be either betas or alphas
* 9. The key to good investing is to create good portfolios of good return streams
* 10. Return streams can be risk adjusted to be risk balanced
* 11. The holy grail of investing is finding 15 or more good uncorrelated return streams
* 12. Systematize decision making; rules should be timeless and universal",elpresidentedeltoro,16,1676400464.0

stocks,1110mwz,Copper producer Freeport McMoRan (FCX) reports setback in Indonesia operations due to floods/landslides.,"They estimate this will disrupt operations through February. Back-of-the-envelope calculations (15 more days) suggest a total of 75M lb of lost copper production and 75K oz. of gold, relative to their 2023 guidance of 900M lb of copper and 300K oz gold. Or 8% of copper production and 25% of gold. Assuming the company cannot make up for it later.

Hopefully it doesn't sell off too badly (as a shareholder), but it might be a nice buying opportunity. The decade looks very promising for copper.

(FCX) announced today that PT Freeport Indonesia's (PT-FI) Grasberg operations have been temporarily disrupted because of significant rainfall and landslides in the area of its milling operations in Papua, Indonesia. Intense rains on Saturday February 11, 2023, resulted in flooding and a flow of debris, causing damage to infrastructure near its milling complex. Personnel were safely evacuated from the localized area.

#[Stock futures climb on Friday as S&P 500 tries to snap 3-week losing streak: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures rose Friday as investors pondered the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate-hiking path in light of fresh commentary from central bank speakers.
*****
> Nasdaq-100 futures were up 0.3%, and S&P 500 futures advanced 0.2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 33 points.
*****
> Those moves come as U.S. Treasury yields retreated. The benchmark 10-year yield fell more than 6 basis points to 4%. The 2-year rate dipped to 4.855%.
*****
> The major averages are on their way to a positive week. The S&P 500 is up 0.28%, on pace to snap a three-week decline, while the Nasdaq has a 0.6% gain. The Dow is also up 0.6% on the week.
*****
> The Dow on Thursday had its best day since Feb. 13, closing 1.1% higher. The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7%. These gains came after Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that he thinks the central bank can keep its interest rate hikes to 25 basis points rather than the half-point increase favored by some other officials.
*****
> However, Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller struck a tougher tone in his comments to the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America, raising the possibility of a higher terminal rate if inflation numbers don‚Äôt cool.
*****
> He referred to January‚Äôs big payrolls report, which showed the economy added 517,000 jobs, as well as the latest reading from the consumer price index and personal consumption expenditures reports.
*****
> ‚ÄúIf those data reports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year even more to ensure that we do not lose the momentum that was in place before the data for January were released,‚Äù Waller said.
*****
> The road ahead is a tough one for the central bank, regardless of the messaging they‚Äôre relaying to the public.
*****
> ‚ÄúNo matter how slow the Fed goes, no matter how much they ‚Äòcommunicate‚Äô what they want to do, there is no avoiding the potholes of reversing extraordinary easing,‚Äù Bleakley chief investment officer Peter Boockvar wrote in a note.
*****
> ‚ÄúWhen markets and the economy have been addicted and medicated for so long on low rates and QE, there will never be the right time to ease up,‚Äù he said.
*****
> On the economic data front, the Institute of Supply Management is due to release its Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers‚Äô Index (PMI) report on Friday morning. Investors will also listen for further commentary from central bank officials, including Fed Governor Michelle Bowman and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin.

stocks,11izbib,"Cowboy Chic Is Hot, but Boot Barn Is No Passing Fad","https://www.barrons.com/articles/boot-barn-stock-small-cap-buy-584af9b

There are plenty of pitfalls when it comes to mixing form and function, but the latest wave of ‚ÄúWesterncore‚Äù sweeping the U.S. looks to have staying power.

The scramble for shearling-collar coats and snap-button shirts, brought on by the success of TV shows like Yellowstone, is one more feather in the cap of Western-wear retailer Boot Barn Holdings (ticker: BOOT). But it‚Äôs worth noting that cowboy chic has cycled in and out of fashion over the decades, and Boot Barn has done just fine. That‚Äôs because it caters to an increasing number of shoppers who are less concerned with trends, as well as others simply trying to look the part.

As the meteoric rise of Tractor Supply (TSCO) has shown in recent years, investors overlook more rural-themed retailers at their own risk.

‚ÄúRight now, Boot Barn is one of the most attractive names in retail,‚Äù says David Swank, co-manager of the Hood River Small-Cap Growth fund (HRSRX), who notes that the company is finding success in the Northeast, a previously untapped geographic region for the brand.

Boot Barn is the undisputed leader in the fragmented $40 billion Western and workwear specialty retail space. It operates more than three times the number of stores as its closest rival, and its lead over competitors has only expanded in recent years, as the pandemic forced smaller operations out of business at the same time the retailer expanded its store base. Boot Barn now has 333 stores, up from 293 in the prior year, and plans to open a total of 43 in its fiscal 2023, which ends on April 1.

The chain‚Äôs stores have gotten more profitable, says Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management. Ten years ago, a new 10,000-square-foot location would generate $1.7 million of revenue in its first year, and would have paid for itself in three. Now, a 12,000-square-foot shop does $3.5 million in business and pays back in 1.4 years, helped by factors like better merchandising and store locations that have helped it appeal to a broader audience.

Those numbers have allowed Boot Barn to bulk up without increasing its net debt, which is less than 0.1 times the past 12 months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda.

‚ÄúStore economics continue to grow,‚Äù says Bradshaw. ‚ÄúIt is one of the best growth stories in retail.‚Äù

Boot Barn‚Äôs exclusive brands, which carry higher margins than national ones, have increasingly become a bigger part of its business, accounting for just over a third of sales last quarter. That has helped boost gross margins, which climbed to 38.6% in fiscal 2022, up from just over 32% before the pandemic.

That profitability was on display when Boot Barn reported fiscal third-quarter results in January, a period that spanned nearly the entire holiday shopping season. Comparable sales were stronger than expected, and management noted that its declining inventory levels meant it didn‚Äôt have to rely on hefty discounts, helping to bolster the stock even as its earnings per share came in a bit light.

Boot Barn tweaked its fiscal-2023 bottom-line and gross-margin guidance lower, to a range of $5.51 to $5.60 per share and about 36.6%, respectively, as higher freight costs offset stronger product margins, although those headwinds look somewhat temporary. The market seemed to think so: Boot Barn stock jumped 17.6% after the release.

J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Matthew Boss raised his price target to $100 from $94 following the results, which would mark a 24% climb from the recent $80.60. He believes that the company‚Äôs momentum will allow it to keep same-store sales growing in the low- to mid-single digit range, helping Boot Barn return to 20% EPS growth by the second half of 2024.

Although the stock has fallen back from its postearnings rally, it‚Äôs still up nearly 30% so far in 2023, easily outpacing the broader market and its fellow retailers. It looks anything but pricey, however. Boot Barn shares trade at just 13 times 12-month forward earnings, well below that of other fast-growing retailers like Dollar General (DG) and Ulta Beauty ULTA (ULTA) which trade around 19 and 21 times, respectively. ‚ÄúIt still trades at a value multiple for a growth story,‚Äù says Bradshaw.

A multiple of 20 times consensus calendar-2023 estimates of $5.89 a share would put Boot Barn at $118, almost 50% higher than its current levels. That isn‚Äôt as aggressive as it sounds. Its five-year average forward valuation has been closer to 19 times, and just getting back to that level equates to nearly $112.

The stock doesn‚Äôt need a higher multiple to keep rising, however. Analysts expect earnings to grow by nearly 9% in fiscal 2024, so Boot Barn shares should do just fine without the multiple expansion. And even those numbers might be too conservative.

‚ÄúCurrent Street estimates could actually be low in the near and longer term as Boot Barn benefits from the continuing shift to a more country aesthetic and its strong pipeline of new stores,‚Äù Swank says. ‚ÄúThe stock should work from here based on fundamentals alone and without multiple expansion.‚Äù

Taiwan, Russia, China, USA, Europe are all going to be producing more weapons/ammunition etc. This is going to continue in the future as we enter a new era of tension between great powers along with Europe and Taiwan playing major roles as well.

Considering the risk to value, defense indexes or even individual stocks if you have the knowledge are a great wait to allocate. Even with a black-swan event with China invading or blockading(which in my opinion is inevitable) defense stocks are going to hedge and do well.

#[Dow futures fall following Thursday‚Äôs market selloff fueled by banks, U.S. jobs report looms](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Friday as investors look to upcoming job data for clues into how the Federal Reserve may move forward. The action follows a steep sell-off led by bank shares.
*****
> Dow futures shed 66 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures dipped 0.1%, and Nasdaq-100 futures traded flat.
*****
> Shares of the SVB Financial tumbled again on Friday, down another 63% after initially plunging on plans to raise more than $2 billion in capital in a bid to offset losses from bond sales.
*****
> The move weighed on the financial sector and banking stocks, with the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF down more than 2%. Shares of First Republic and Signature Bank were last down about 18% and 12%, respectively.
*****
> Wall Street posted a losing session Thursday. A drop in SVB Financial shares spurred a broad financial sector selloff, as investors grew concerned that higher interest rates would result in banks facing losses on loans due to borrower defaults. The selloff pushed the S&P‚Äôs financial sector down 4.1% for its worst day since 2020.
*****
> On Thursday, the Nasdaq Composite recorded a 2.05% slide, while the S&P 500 posted a 1.85% dip. The Dow lost 543.54 points, or 1.66%, as the 30-stock index closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 9. All three major averages are on pace to finish the week down 3% or more.
*****
> Wall Street is bracing for February jobs report, which is slated to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect nonfarm payrolls to rise 225,000 in the month, which would mark a slowdown in growth from January‚Äôs unexpectedly large gain of 517,000.
*****
> The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged from January ‚Äî when it hit a low not seen since 1969 ‚Äî at 3.4%, according to Dow Jones. Hourly wages are expected to have increased 0.4% from the prior month, gaining 4.8% from 12 months ago, economists estimate.
*****
> While having more jobs is considered good for the economy, a better-than-expected report can push stocks lower, according to Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. That‚Äôs because more workers can signal more demand, he said, which would indicate higher inflation.
*****
> Traders are pricing in a roughly 63% chance of the Federal Reserve raising rates by half of a percentage point at its next policy meeting in about two weeks, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Investors see Friday‚Äôs job report as a key driver in that decision, given the central bank‚Äôs continued focus on the strength of the labor market as a justification for rate increases.
*****
> ‚ÄúA strong report would be bad news for the Fed, for interest rates, and for markets,‚Äù McMillan said.

stocks,11goi2l,"Core & Main (CNM), a quick overview"," The following is a quick overview of the company Core & Main. 

What do they do?

Core and Main (CNM) manufactures and distributes specialty products used in the maintenance, repair, and construction of water and fire protection infrastructure. They operate in 3 segments: Residential, Non-residential, and municipal. They make and maintain water infrastructure. 

Why is the company interesting?

The company has an interesting history. It used to be part of Home Depot as part of their HD supply division. A lot of the management was involved in the company during this time. It was purchased by private equity in 2017. The company IPO‚Äôd in 2021. I think that water infrastructure in the U.S. has been ignored for a long time. Flint, Jackson, and countless other cities are feeling the consequences of these decisions. Core & Main is fit to capitalize on this.

Management

The CEO, Steve Leclair has been with the company (in all its forms) since 2005. He was head of the division when it was part of Home Depot. That‚Äôs a nice company to learn from, and if a manager has a long career with HD, they probably have done something right. Numerous other executives date back to the Home Depot days too. 

Growth strategy

The company operates in a fragmented industry. There are countless small distributors scattered across the US. CNM has been on an acquisition spree. Their website actually has information if you want to sell your distribution business to them. They have completed 23 purchases since 2017. THese companies are bolt on acquisitions since they are essentially in the same business. CNM then brings the business up to its standards, and eliminates redundancies. The new company is almost immediately contributing to earnings. 

The company also benefits from increased construction, both residential and commercial. This is actually a headwind for them as residential construction is slowing. Industrial and municipal construction has been holding up much better so far, but can also drop in a recession. Analysts are predicting a drop in earnings next year.

They are not dependent on new construction though. Fully half of their revenue comes from repair and replace work. These repairs would likely happen in any economy because their customers need water.

Gross margins are around 26%, and growing. Sales have increased at a 26% CAGR since FY 2019. Return on Equity is around 23%. Those are all solid numbers.

Do they have a moat?

Morningstar rates the company as having a narrow moat. I agree. As they add more businesses to their company it creates a flywheel effect allowing them to create an economy of scale. This allows them to become more efficient, offer better pricing, and thus enhance their further growth.

I will say that since this is a newer public company the moat hasn‚Äôt been tested and there isn‚Äôt a long established business history.

Risks

My biggest gripe with the company is their lack of GAAP reporting. They do, of course, report their GAAP numbers on the 10Q/k, but their press releases highlight adjusted EBITDA, which is not a real accounting figure. They adjust out equity based compensation, some debt restructuring payments, some acquisition costs, and IPO expenses. These aren‚Äôt egregious things to omit in my opinion, especially their debt and IPO costs. These are costs that should not be permanent for the company, but over adjusting on earnings releases is a pet peeve of mine. 

The company does have a lot of debt. The latest figures I have are $1.7 billion in debt, however this is down from $2.1 billion in 2020. Management has made debt reduction a priority.

They have a two class stock system, which is another pet peeve of mine. This is a result of their time with private equity, and those people trying to retain special privileges. Not my favorite corporate setup.

Being a recent IPO, there also isn't a long history to go by. This makes it hard to judge how consistent the business will be.

Conclusions

I own no position in this company. It offers an intriguing value, trading at 11x earnings and EV/EBITDA around 10. Those numbers combined with 20% or more growth would make the stock undervalued, in my opinion. However, The company is expecting a decline in earnings next year. This is due to the economic slowdown as well as a regression to the mean after the covid building boom of 2021. FY 2022 should be out this month, and it will be interesting to see how the business is holding up.",creemeeseason,11,1677810122.0

The rest of my Trad IRA is composed of SDY, $3,000 cash, and the total market value of the account is $14,000.

$6,000 plus small gains makes up the only non-deductible amount in the account.

I've been told I should do a backdoor Roth.

My questions are:

1. Should I do the backdoor, and if so, should I do it all in one go or space it out over a few years?
2. Should I wait to do it altogether? If the economy crashes and then I do it, I'll pay lower taxes on the conversion (I think)

stocks,118hd8h,SNAP vs. PINS,"I'm wondering if folks have any opinions of SNAP vs. PINS, as I'm considering a spread trade (long one short the other). Here's the deltas that I find (keep in mind SNAP reports things in DAU and PINS reports things as MAU, therefore things like ARPU are not comparable between them):

\- As of today PINS has a higher market cap than SNAP ($16.77B vs. $15.51B)

\- SNAP has a lot more revenue than PINS ($4.6B vs. $2.8B for FY2022)

\- SNAP has a lot more debt than PINS does (about $4B more)

\- They both break out revenue into NorAM, Europe, and Rest of World (ROW). Revenue growth is pretty flat across all geographies for both companies, with the exception of SNAP's RoW which is +28% YoY.

\- SNAP has 750M MAU vs. 450M MAU for PINs

\- ARPMAU is very similar: $6.13 (Snap) vs. $6.22 (Pins) (Note: SNAP in its earnings release reports ARPDAU as opposed to ARPMAU, this is calculated based on taking revenue divided by their MAU).

What explains PINS being worth more than SNAP despite significantly lower revenue / users? Is it simply that SNAP's balance sheet looks so much better? Anyone have any insights?",jonesmanbob,13,1677019141.0
stocks,116b6yl,Having trouble figuring out how to bet against the broader stock market,"Hiya!

I'm happy with the shape of my portfolio for long-term stock investments. I have a decently diversified portfolio with carefully picked stocks I think will be long-term winners (1 to 5 years). But I'm bearish on the rest of the year for the broader stock market. I think higher interest rates aren't (fully) priced-in to the market, and I think this jubilant 2023 stock market is going to recede into the background as the reality of bad earnings and higher interest rates set in. 

I have cash, and am looking for ways to invest that profit off my prediction that the rest of the year will feature declining indices. I have never bet against the market before, so this is new to me, and I'm struggling to figure it out. 

The first thing I looked at were put options. I picked a few stocks I don't like for the rest of 2023: Redfin and OpenDoor Technologies in the real estate sector, and manufacturers of expensive-ish EVs like Rivian and Lucid. I priced out put options, but felt it was too much risk for me. Why?

First, the put options feel like they reward you for short-term volatility. I want a longer term outlook than 30/60/90 days.  

Second, picking anti-stocks is scarier for me than finding long-term investments. I found myself thinking a lot of: ""What if I'm wrong? What if the broader market is down, but US government incentives mean Rivian or Lucid do well, even as consumers start to actually feel pain? Or what if Redfin should tank, but doesn't, because higher interest rates take time for home buyers to feel pain?""

Finally, If I'm wrong about stocks I'm going long in, the decline is generally slow or perhaps predictable, and I can get out with a small-ish win or loss. If I'm wrong about a put option, it feels like I'm going to lose everything I put in.

The next think I looked at was inverse ETFs. I know almost nothing about them, so I've been doing some reading.  And everything I'm reading says they're for very short term investing (like, daily settlement) because over the long term, an inverse ETF will always be a loser.  That seems like the opposite of what I'm trying to do, so no inverse ETFs?

Now I'm lost. 

I think the market will be lower at the end of 2023 than it is today. I'm not sure which indices will be better or worse than others, but I have cash and am willing to bet against all of them if I can find vehicles for doing so. I tried searching this subreddit, but didn't find a whole lot of strategies except about inverse ETFs. (My favorite was the anti-Jim Cramer ETF, SJIM. LOL. And a lot of chatter about betting against Cathie Wood, of course.)

stocks,112toae,"Asia stocks fall, dollar stands firm after sticky U.S. CPI"," 

Asian stocks slipped while the U.S. dollar held firm on Wednesday following U.S. inflation data and remarks from central bank officials that have investors worrying interest rates are going to be higher for longer.

European equity markets looked set to follow Asia lower. The pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures slipped 0.21%, German DAX futures were down 0.23%, and FTSE futures edged down 0.11%.

Headline U.S. consumer inflation came in at 6.4% year-on-year for January, a bit higher than the 6.2% economists had expected, setting off selling in the bond market and Fed funds futures as hopes that rates could be cut later this year grow dimmer.

Fed funds futures now imply a peak above 5.2% by mid-year and rates above 5% at year's end.

Two-year Treasury yields, which rise when prices fall, climbed nearly nine basis points in New York trade to 4.611%, widening their premium over 10-year rates - an unusual phenomenon that reliably signals recession.

By early afternoon, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 1.4%, led by drops of more than 1% in Australia and Hong Kong. Japan's Nikkei share average sank, reversing a small early gain.

S&P 500 futures dropped 0.4% in Asia. Wall Street stocks ended mixed on Tuesday after the inflation reading.

Analysts were bracing for further falls.

""If I combine this earlier (U.S.) Fed rhetoric trying to keep the rates higher for longer and the recent CPI number...then it seems likely that there should be some degree of moderation in the equity markets, both developed markets and Asian markets,"" said Manishi Raychaudhuri, head of Asia Pacific equity research at BNP Paribas.

He said the dollar might also regain some strength over emerging market currencies, helped by the prospect of U.S. rates staying elevated.

The dollar touched a six-week high of 133.30 Japanese yen overnight and hovered at 133.05 yen on Wednesday. It had a bumpier ride against other currencies following the CPI data, but seems to be pausing following a January slide.

The dollar index against other major currencies was steady at 103.4.

The Australian dollar eased a bit to $0.6938 even as central bank Governor Philip Lowe said rates would need to rise further to contain inflation in remarks to a parliamentary committee.

China's central bank ramped up medium-term liquidity injections as it rolled over maturing policy loans on Wednesday, while keeping the interest rate unchanged, matching market expectations. But the mainland's stock markets slid broadly by early afternoon as investors wait for more signs of whether an expected economic recovery is gaining traction.

Oil prices fell as traders worried about mounting supplies and weakening demand. U.S. crude dipped 0.86% to $78.38 a barrel. Brent crude fell to $84.87.

Gold gave up some early gains by afternoon. Spot gold traded at $1847.5085 per ounce. Bitcoin clung to an overnight bounce at $22,114.",TheRock_0001,12,1676451638.0
stocks,111s4jx,Arista Stock Is Rising. Profits Topped Estimates.,"https://www.barrons.com/articles/arista-earnings-stock-price-2f5284ae

Arista Networks stock is gaining ground in late trading Monday after the networking-infrastructure provider posted better-than-expected results for the December quarter.

Arista (ticker: ANET) providers routers and other networking gear to cloud providers, with Microsoft MSFT +3.12%  (MSFT) and Meta Platforms META +3.03%  (META) the company‚Äôs two largest customers. In the latest quarter, Meta was 25.5% of revenue, with Microsoft accounting for another 15%. In short, Arista continues to be a beneficiary of the growth in cloud-computing demand.

On a call with the Street, the company noted that ‚Äúcloud titans‚Äù now account for 46% of revenue, with revenue from that group growing triple digits in the fourth quarter.

Arista reported fourth-quarter revenue of $1.28 billion, up 55% from a year earlier, and ahead of the Street consensus at $1.2 billion. Non-GAAP profits were $1.41 a share, 20 cents above the Street consensus view at $1.21 a share. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the company earned $1.35 a share.

For all of 2022, Arista had $4.38 billion of revenue, up 49% from the previous year, with non-GAAP profits of $4.58 a share, up from $2.87 a year earlier.

Arista projects first-quarter revenue of $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion, with non-GAAP gross margin of 60%, down from 61% in the fourth quarter, and non-GAAP operating margin of 40%, down from 42.6% in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, Street consensus estimates call for revenue of $1.21 billion. At the middle of the range, revenue growth would be 48%.

For all of 2023, the company sees top-line growth of about 25%, with year-over-year comparisons getting tougher as the year unfolds.

One quarter ago, Arista provided a detailed forward business model. The company projected non-GAAP gross margin of 61% to 63% for 2023, with a long-term target (through 2025) of 61% to 64%. Arista projected research and development for 2023 to be 14% of revenue, with a long-term target of 15%. Operating margin was projected to be about 40%, with a long-term view of 38%.",_hiddenscout,12,1676343861.0

And still generating a solid loss.. like 100M+ per quarter...
And has a massive debt.. 1000M+

And the only way to succeed with the chapter 11 is to convert debt to stock which essentially makes the stock a lot less worth, as it.. the way I understand it.. is watered out with all the new stocks from the converted debt ..

stocks,11mc8ec,West Fraser Timber DD,"TLDR; West Fraser Timber is slightly overvalued with a negative margin of safety. They are very attractive in the moment, but it is because of a spike in lumber prices, and over the long term, these results are not expected.

‚Äã West Fraser Timber (WFG) is a Canadian lumber company that produces different wood/wood related products. They have lumber mills in North America and Europe. They have the largest market cap, the most revenue, and the most earning in the industry. They also produce the largest volume of sawn wood in the world, making them the largest lumber company in the North America, if not, the world.

One of the major owners of WFG is the Canadian billionaire, Jim Pattison. In response to speculation that Pattison intends to merge WFG with Canfor (another lumber company), WFG has adopted a shareholder rights plan. WFG has recently experienced significant volatilities relating to its principal product, lumber, which may be tainting some ratios and figure to appear much more attractive than what is to be expected long term.

Founded in 1955 by three brothers, the company has had a history of calculated growth and acquisitions. By 1960 they had $550,000 in sales, and in 1963 they made their first acquisition. By 1970 sales were $24.2 million, and by 1975 they are $48 million, driven by acquisitions. They went public in 1986. In 1994, they made the decision to preserve the largest intact costal rainforest in the world (which was 7 times the size of Redwood National Park), an early decision towards promoting environmental stewardship. By 1995, sales were $1.5 billion, and in 2007 they became the largest lumber producer in North America. The current CEO was appointed in 2019.

In the three years after his appointment, revenues have averaged twice the revenues of the preceding decade, a fact that will have to be examined more thoroughly as it correlates to commodity prices. In lieu of having contacts with company analysts, insiders, and historians, we can correlate financial trends with management commentary to gauge performance, results attained, and rationality.

We can see a clear drop in 2009 on the income statement, which is obviously attributable to the financial crisis. It would be interesting to hear the company narrative on this event. On page 4 of the 2008 annual report, the CEO gets straight to the point, but emphasizes that the underlying business is strong, as seen on the balance sheet. Before we get into what the CEO had to say in defence of WFC, we should take a look at the company values and see if they align with his strategy. They are:

‚Ä¢ cost control in all aspects of the business

‚Ä¢ efficient, modern mills

‚Ä¢ responsibility and leadership in environmental performance

‚Ä¢ the active involvement of employees in the business

‚Ä¢ a relentless pursuit of excellence in everything we do

His response to naysayers in the crisis:

‚ÄúOver the years West Fraser has followed a business strategy which, we believe, allows us to prosper in the good times while always being prepared for the bad times. This strategy can be summarized as follows. First, we continually invest in our plants and equipment to ensure a low-cost operating structure. Second, we operate with a lean, flat and flexible management structure. Third, we have an incredibly talented and dedicated team of employees who live, breathe, and promote our frugal cost control environment in good times and bad. And fourth, we try to maintain a solid and conservative balance sheet.‚Äù

It does seem that the company lived up to its values in extreme crisis. He goes on about the business strategy moving forward, and about the negative impacts of the crisis. He assures readers of commitments the company has made to employees, the environment, and shareholders. The company rebounded within the next year, living up to what he told shareholders, including the companies first priority, cost control as evident in the decreased number of employees following a 2007 peak.

The current financial position of the company is attributable to a temporary increase in lumber prices. The CEO does not recognize this in his 2021 letter to shareholders, attributing the financial performance to their employees in a year where lumber prices were temporarily spectacular. Without performing technical analysis on lumber prices, it is clear that there is an average price for the good that is much lower than the prices experienced in 2021. Consumers will only pay so much for a product in a highly competitive industry. This also coincides with a hot housing market.

The long-term prospects of the company are not reflected by its short-term history. We will factor that into any valuations we do. There is a high variance for many of their long-term financial ratios, so let‚Äôs look at averages since 1995, and compare them to the current values:

|Field|2022 Value|28 year average|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Return on Equity|25.01%|11.64%|
|Return on Invested Capital|23.46%|9.21%|
|Return on Assets|19.33%|5.03%|
|Inventory Turnover|4.61|4.38|
|Net Profit Margin|20.36%|6.55%|
|Debt to Equity|0.10|0.40|
|Price to Book|0.78|1.34|
|Price to Free Cash Flow|2.93|59.79|

Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if things were the other way around? The company is solid in the long term, but you would not expect Phillip Fischer to recommend it to you. Maybe 20 years ago, but it is so large now that it dominates a competitive industry, achieved through aggressive acquisitions. The current results are not indicative of what has historically been achieved and are not a result of exceptional employees or managerial decisions, but they do provide a unique opportunity to strengthen the company position. There are opportunities for growth equal to the growth of demand for lumber, but also pegged to the price of lumber. Because of frequent acquisitions, the average sales growth of the company is not indicative of long-term growth expectations for a mature commodities company. Long term growth of such a company could eventually end up being the rate of new housing starts plus some price index rate, such as inflation or average increase in lumber prices.

In the following section, a DCF is calculated. But there is a major assumption made: that the financial results after 2020 are not indicative of future growth. Because of the extremely favorable current financial position, a positive adjustment for the next two years is made, but after that, the average growth rate is assumed.

If we assume that the growth in Canadian housing starts in indicative of the growth in demand for lumber, we arrive at 2.264% each year. We should then look at the price of softwood lumber, apart from 2020 and onwards. Over a 30-year period, I found that the average annual price appreciation of lumber is 0.381%. If the company did nothing but cut down trees and sell them at market prices, it would grow at an estimated 2.645%. However, we know that WFC has a propensity to acquire businesses, so to credit their own ability to expand, we can look at their net income growth over the past 25 years, excluding the price spike following 2020. We arrive at 4.184% CAGR. Management has not announced any big plans to grow the company more than they already do, so this is a reasonable value to use to project long term growth. The premium the company brings would be found by subtracting our base growth for the lumber industry, which is 4.184%-2.264% = 1.92%.

For the DCF take a starting free cash flow of $590 million (arrived at by looking at the average OCF/interest expense from 2017-2020), a premium growth rate in the next two years of 8%, and then a continuing growth rate of 1.92%, discounted with an estimated RFR of 4.17% and we arrive at the following intrinsic value (10 yr DCF) of $5.850 billion. The margin of safety is negative. A last ditch measure to see if there is any value is to look at the value of its land assets.

PP&E in 2021 is $4.1 billion, up over 100% from 2020. The fair value assessed for their land is $2.088 billion. Most of the land they operate on is actual granted crown land, but WFC would have control over about $34 billion in timber if all trees on all of its managed crown land were fully grown. But the land is not owned by them, so it is not considered an asset, and less than 5% of their managed crown land is ready to be cut down, so there are not hidden assets so to speak of.

Based on the research above, the conclusion is that West Fraser Timber is not a value play.",StocksAndMilfs,12,1678318962.0
stocks,11egah5,Are non-dividend stocks pure speculation?,"Hello guys, this is a post I wrote 220 days ago but couldn‚Äôt publish due to a lack of Reddit karma. Funny to see how my examples aged, but my core question is still valid so I post again.

I know this kind of a question has been recently often asked on this sub, but the more I read and the more I get confused.

The main counter argument that I‚Äôve read is that as a shareholder you actually own a part of the company, which includes its assets but also its cash. That‚Äôs true yes, but what can you do from it in reality ? Nothing. We cannot request to trade our stock directly with the company for the asset/cash equivalent. 
The only options to get money from your stock are :
- company is bought by another one
- dividend is distributed 
- you sell higher than you bought.

If none of the two first options happens, then it seems to be like speculation. You sell higher to someone that expects to also sell higher.
Also let‚Äôs not forget that companies keep a big part of stocks on their side so they can still control what happens in the company (e.g. dividend distribution).

Let‚Äôs take an example : SNAP.
The stock selling price has decreased by 90% over a year. 
There was a time the company was actually profitable with a bright future. It made sense to invest at that time and to expect at some point a return on the investment.
Now the stock price has dropped and what can you do from it ? Maybe the company is going to oblivion, not able to generate free cash flow anymore until eventually get delisted. And then what ? The only thing I can see is ¬´¬†you should not have invested in this company¬†¬ª.
Ok but what about Google, Amazon etc. Do you say the same ? What if Amazon has the same outcome in few years ? If it starts to fall what can you do ? 

Note: I have never owned SNAP stocks.",General_Present2163,10,1677609785.0
stocks,11durb9,Zoom shares jump on better-than-expected fourth-quarter results,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/27/zoom-zm-earnings-q4-2023.html

Zoom shares climbed 8% in extended trading on Monday after the video chat company reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that exceeded analysts‚Äô estimates and offered optimistic earnings guidance for the year.

Here‚Äôs how the company did:

Earnings: $1.22 per share, adjusted, vs. 81 cents as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue: $1.12 billion, vs. $1.10 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Zoom‚Äôs revenue increased 4% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Jan. 31, according to a statement. That‚Äôs a dramatic slowdown from the quadrupling of revenue that Zoom enjoyed in 2020 and 2021, when consumers and businesses flocked to the video service during the Covid pandemic.

The company had its first net loss since 2018 in the quarter, losing $104 million compared with net income of about $491 million in the year-ago period. The loss stems from stock-based compensation costs.

Zoom continued to face issues it had encountered earlier in the 2023 fiscal year during the quarter, including executives looking carefully before agreeing to pay the company for services, CEO Eric Yuan told analysts on a conference call.

Some organizations have decreased the number of seats for which they buy Zoom‚Äôs software as part of broader expense pullbacks, Kelly Steckelberg, the company‚Äôs finance chief, said on the conference call.

Growth will continue to slow this year. Zoom sees between $4.435 billion to $4.455 billion in revenue, implying 1.1% growth, while analysts were expecting sales of $4.6 billion. The company said adjusted earnings per share will be between $4.11 and $4.18, topping the $3.66 average estimate.

For the fiscal first quarter, adjusted earnings will be 96 cents to 98 cents per share on revenue of $1.080 billion to $1.085 billion. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had expected 84 cents in adjusted earnings per share and $1.11 billion in revenue.

stocks,11cxn2a,Education - P/E & Price to Free Cash Flow,"Hello,

I am starting this topic for education purposes only. I recently learned about P/E ratio and the Price to Free Cash Flow ratio. With that knowledge, I looked up two organizations to compare and practice what I learned (so far):

* JPM (JPMORGAN CHASE & CO) :
   * P/E ratio of 11.67 and FCF ratio of $36.12
      * FCF pulled from seeking alpha
* BAC (Bank of America)
   * P/E ratio 10.72 and FCF ratio of -$0.78
      * FCF pulled from seeking alpha

With the above figures, would the educated investor assume that JPM is the healthier financial organization and therefore, it is the more lucrative option for investment? Are there other factors to be evaluated/reviewed?

China's Baidu Inc beat revenue estimates for the fourth quarter on Wednesday, bolstered by strength in its advertising, cloud and artificial intelligence businesses.

The search engine giant, which generates most of its revenue from online ads, is seeing advertisers return after China lifted its zero-COVID policies last year in a boost to the country's economic prospects.

The company also announced a new share repurchase program of up to $5 billion.

Quarterly revenue came in at 33.08 billion yuan ($4.80 billion), inching past analysts' estimates of 32.01 billion yuan, according to Refinitiv data.

Revenue from Baidu Core, which includes search-based ad sales, cloud offerings and its autonomous driving initiatives, fell 1% to 25.7 billion yuan.

Baidu's research and development expenses were 21.4 billion yuan, accounting for 22.4% of revenue, as it plans to integrate its ChatGPT-like Ernie Bot into cloud, smart cars and household appliances, among other mainstream businesses.

The AI-driven chatbot, seen by many as China's most promising answer to the platform developed by OpenAI and backed by Microsoft Corp, will complete internal testing in March.

""The Chinese AI market is on the verge of experiencing an explosive growth in demand, releasing unprecedented and exponential commercial value. Baidu stands as the best example of the long-term growth of China's AI market and is advancing at the forefront of this new wave,"" Baidu CEO Robin Li said.

Li added that the developers of Ernie Bot were sparing no effort to ensure the chatbot was made available as early as possible.",Puginator,11,1677067321.0

**Dividends are a form of payment made out to stockholders of a company. In other words, the company essentially shares a certain percentage of its profits with its stockholders. Dividends are typically paid on a quarterly basis ‚Äì or at least four times a year and are an excellent way for investors (big and small) to generate a passive income from stocks.**

When it comes to securing a consistent passive income from stocks, it doesn't get any better than investing in dividend stocks. You see, as a reputed and growth-centric private or public company makes profits, it funnels a calculated portion of its profits and cycles it back to the stockholders and investors in the form of dividends. Now the best part is that investors can either take the cash and do whatever they want with it or be smart and reinvest it back into the company and acquire more shares.

In simple terms, the dividend yield for a stock is the amount it pays in dividends per share every year divided by the current price of that share. It basically indicates the amount of return you'll receive every year contingent on the recent price of that stock.

Therefore, dividend yields can be highly volatile from one organization to another, and each yield can considerably increase or plummet on a year-to-year basis. This is primarily why many investors who aren't entirely sure of what dividend stocks to go for invest in companies that are hailed as 'dividend aristocrats.' This simply means investing in companies with a super impressive record of consistently paying dividends ‚Äì typically for more than 25 years.

Short for trailing twelve months, TTM is annualized data that investors can proficiently use to evaluate recent or current financial data. TTM is vital as it helps eliminate the risk of seasonality and minimizes the impact of nonrepetitive inconsistencies in financial factors such as fluctuations in expenses, demand, or cash flow.

Utilizing TTM, investors and/or analysts can assess recent monthly or quarterly financial reports instead of having to go through older data that mainly contains a company's overall fiscal or annual information. However, keep in mind that using TTM charts is less effective for short-term changes and significantly useful for long-term financial forecasting.

In the US, companies typically make dividend payments on a quarterly basis. However, some companies pay dividends monthly and/or every six months. Each dividend payout is approved by the company's board of directors, after which the organization will announce the date of the next dividend, the amount, and the ex-dividend date.

The ex-dividend date is an immensely vital component for investors. It's the final date to buy and own the stocks to be eligible for the dividends on those stocks. If you purchase any stock after the ex-dividend date, you will not earn any dividends. However, investors that sell their stocks after the ex-dividend date will still be eligible for receiving dividends as they already owned the stock before the deadline.

Companies listed as dividend aristocrats in the S&P 500 index are businesses that have a significantly long history of paying dividends each year for up to 25 years or more. Here are five great examples of dividend aristocrats:

### Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NYSE: WBA)

The biggest pharmaceutical company in the US and Europe ‚Äì Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, has been consecutively paying dividends for over 88 years and has a dividend yield of 4.03%.

### Roper Technologies (NYSE: ROP)

One of the biggest technology companies in the US, Roper Technologies, has been paying dividends for 25 years and has a dividend yield of 0.50%.

### Lowe's Companies (NYSE: LOW)

Lowe's Companies has been paying dividends for over 25 years. The company's dividend yield is 1.26%.

### Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE: SWK)

One of the world's biggest hardware and appliances manufacturers, Stanley Black & Decker, has been paying dividends for more than 54 years. The company's dividend yield is 1.7%.

### Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)

Referred as the 'king of dividends', Coca-Cola has been paying dividends for more than 25 years and has a dividend yield of 3.1%.

These are mutual funds that hold stock from different companies and pay regular dividends to investors quarterly. So, if you've invested in dividend mutual funds, the dividend payout will be made to that fund. Then, the mutual fund will then transfer payments to the investors. Moreover, dividend funds typically comprise of dividend aristocrats that have a long history of consistently paying dividends.

Some examples of dividend mutual funds:

* The Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund (VDIGX); SEC Yield ‚Äì 1.48%
* The Federated Strategic Value Dividend Fund (SVAAX); SEC Yield ‚Äì 3.21%

stocks,11kwihi,"Block: Addressing the Twin Elephants in the Room with New Investment Framework, but is Afterpay Elephant #3?","Block (SQ -0.72%‚Üì) reported Q4 2022 earnings on February 23 and it was an unusual affair. Gross profits, excluding Afterpay (more on this below), grew a resilient 24%, with each of Cash App and Square surpassing Wall Street expectations. Instead of trumpeting this crucial outperformance immediately on the earnings call, co-founder Jack Dorsey began his opening remarks highlighting a brand new investment framework in which 2022 results fell short:

*There are three principles guiding our investment framework:*

* *Number one, ensure our investments are focused on customer retention and growth;*
* *Number two,* ***account for ongoing cost of the business, including stock-based compensation****; and*
* *Number three, utilize industry standard conventions that are simple to communicate and to understand.*

*Block, in each of our ecosystems, must show a believable path to gross profit retention of over 100% and* ***Rule of 40*** *on adjusted operating income.* ***This is an ambitious goal, especially at our scale, and one we aren't meeting today.***

By addressing the twin issues of costs and stock-based compensation upfront on the investor call, Dorsey may be signaling a new era for Block. After all, with 2022 gross profits of almost $6bn - more than double that of competitor Shopify (SHOP ) - it may be overdue for GAAP profitability.

stocks,117127o,Stock Bearing the Brunt of Adani Rout Is at Risk of More Losses," Adani Group stocks have seen more than $132 billion of market value wiped out since the explosive Hindenburg Research report, but none is hit as bad as Adani Total Gas Ltd. 

 

ITs shares have lost more three quarters of their value since the short seller report was published on Jan. 24. It was the group‚Äôs most richly valued stock before that and also has relatively less liquidity. Hindenburg had calculated that, on average, seven of the conglomerate‚Äôs shares were overvalued by 85%.

Adani Total was down by its limit in early trading on Monday. It has done so each day since Jan. 27, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Indian exchanges tweaked the daily limit for the stock to 5% from 20% as the selloff worsened.

Adani Total Gas ‚Äúis under fundamental as well as technical pressure, which has led to the downfall,‚Äù said Abhay Agarwal, a fund manager with Piper Serica Advisors Pvt. A fall in European gas prices is adding to company-specific woes and ‚Äúwill put pressure on the profitability,‚Äù he added.

 

Concerns about access to overseas financing at the Adani Group remain even as the equity-market shock from allegations of stock manipulation and accounting fraud leveled by Hindenburg is starting to abate.

Billionaire Gautam Adani and his companies have taken steps from repaying loans to pledging to reduce leverage ratios but debt and cashflow levels continue to worry investors.

Following the Hindenburg report, French energy giant TotalEnergies SE put a multi-billion dollar plan to produce green hydrogen with Adani Group on hold, in a setback to the gas unit. Another concern are Adani Total Gas‚Äô debt levels.

The company faces combined maturing debt payments in the fourth quarter of its 2023 fiscal year and the 2024 fiscal year that amount to more than its cash balance, according to an exchange filing. It also has, however, cash flow from assets of 9.32 billion rupees.

The stock‚Äôs float, or the amount available to trade in the public market, is about 19%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That‚Äôs the lowest among the group after Adani Wilmar Ltd.

*****
> U.S. stock futures were little changed Wednesday, a day after a selloff spurred by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell‚Äôs comments indicating interest rates may need to go higher for longer.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked higher by 35 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures rose marginally.
*****
> The Dow closed nearly 575 points lower on Tuesday. The S&P 500 slid 1.53% to close below the key 4,000 threshold, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.25%. The sharp decline for stocks was accompanied by a spike in bond yields, with the rate on the 2-year Treasury surpassing 5% and touching the highest level since 2007.
*****
> The shakeup in markets came after Fed Chair Powell spoke before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. He cautioned lawmakers that the central bank‚Äôs terminal rate will likely be higher than previously anticipated due to stubbornly high economic data in recent weeks.
*****
> ‚Ä≥[Powell] is being very, very clear that if you look at what happened over the past year and a half, the call on inflation didn‚Äôt pan out,‚Äù Morgan Stanley‚Äôs global chief economist Seth Carpenter said on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell: Overtime.‚Äù
*****
> ‚ÄúI think now Powell is very much on board with the idea that he does not want to get caught flat-footed again, and so opening the door very wide for a 50 basis point hike was exactly what he did,‚Äù Carpenter added.
*****
> On Wednesday, investors will be closely watching Powell speak before the House Financial Services Committee. Separately, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin will also be speaking on the labor market Wednesday morning. January‚Äôs job openings and labor turnover data is due, as is the ADP jobs report for February.

The call options ask price + the strike price of the current deep ITM calls are typically pretty close to the current market price. The tax implications of this strategy are also no different than buying the stock at the market price, as the option premium price is added to the strike price to form the cost basis (which is pretty close to the market price) for tax calculation purposes, as described in this [article](https://www.moneyshow.com/articles/optionsidea-42816/tax-treatment-for-call-and-put-options/).

# [Stock futures rise Wednesday to start a new month of trading: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/28/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Wednesday, the first day of March, as traders tried to recover their footing following a losing month.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 64 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.3%, while Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.4%.
*****
> Sentiment got a boost after the release of much stronger-than-expected data out of China. The country‚Äôs National Bureau of Statistics said its official manufacturing PMI rose to 52.6 in February ‚Äî a high not seen since April 2012.
*****
> The moves come after Wall Street closed out a losing February for stocks on Tuesday. The Dow led the averages down, closing the month down 4.19%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite shed 2.61% and 1.11%, respectively.
*****
> February‚Äôs slide dragged the Dow into negative territory for the year, while the other two indexes are still holding onto their gains.
*****
> The decline marked a turn from January‚Äôs rally and was prompted in part by the bombshell jobs data that came in the first week of the month, according to Keith Buchanan, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 517,000 in January, according to the report, which crushed the 187,000 estimated by economists polled by Dow Jones.
*****
> ‚ÄúThere was a turning point that we can all point to,‚Äù Buchanan said. ‚ÄúThe market had a moment where participants realized that perhaps the labor market is tight enough to continue to set the stage for increasing hawkishness.‚Äù
*****
> Investors will watch for economic data on construction and manufacturing coming after the market opens Wednesday.

stocks,11arotc,Transfering to buying savings bonds?,"I'm not really a super pessimist, so I figure I'll just sit on my current portfolio and let it more or less recover on its own since I invested almost exclusively in blue chips. So in the mean time, rather than dollar cost average cause who knows how long the market will stagnate or keep dipping, I'm putting my savings in bonds and T bills while the interest rates are high. Are you also doing this? I know the amount of impact we would have on inflation is infintesimal even if everyone in this sub got savings bonds with our disposable income, but, dammit, it still feels like the right thing to do, like picking up litter off the sidewalk.",DoubleTFan,8,1677246162.0
stocks,11abwri,JBSS- a small cap defensive company," 

JBSS

Who are they?

John. B Sanfilipino & Sons (JBSS) is a processor and distributor of mixed nuts in the U.S. They sell their products under several brands and also package private label products for numerous grocery chains. It has a market cap of around $1 billion and pays a dividend of 0.85% as well as regular special dividends. 

The company has been increasing their ROIC from the low teens in 2018 to 20-21% in the last few years. They have low amounts of debt ($36 million) and have increased earnings at a 11.6% CAGR since 2013.

Their CEO has been in the position since 2016, and with the company since 1991. It is safe to say he is intimately familiar with the company. In fact, Jeff Sanfilipino is the 4th generation of his family to head the company. He also owns about $1.6 million worth of company stock. It is safe to say his interests are aligned with the company.

Why is this a good company?

The company has consistently grown their ROIC for a long time. They have grown the business through occasional acquisitions, as well as organic growth. The biggest driver of their growth has been increased consumer sales. Nuts offer some of the healthiest vegan protein and changing diets can be a growth driver. This grew 9% last year.

They also provide private label packaging for stores, which grew at 7% and commercial ingredients, which grew at 29%. This is their biggest growth segment right now.

THey are trying to diversify into snack foods, as opposed to just nuts. They recently acquired the Orchard valley brand which produces mixed nuts and dried fruits. In the US, snack foods are a $108 billion market, and JBSS is looking to get into a healthy corner of that market.

Some downsides‚Ä¶

This is a no moat business. There is nothing to keep a consumer from eating Planters instead of JBSS. They do have contracts for their private label manufacturing, but I don‚Äôt think that enough to be a moat. 

They sell an agricultural product, so there are also risks of commodity price fluctuation, or crop disruption. I‚Äôm not qualified to weigh in on how likely these things are, but this company has been in business since 1922, so they have a history of surviving hard times. 

Also, according to their 10K they do have significant customer concentration. 63% of sales are to their 5 largest customers. My understanding is that this has to do with the nature of food distribution companies. They are trying to do more DTC sales, but that's not likely to be a big part of their business.

Conclusions

I do not have a position in this company. There are not many defensive companies that can put up 15%+ ROIC for a long time. JBSS does it. They return a large amount of that cash to shareholders through dividends, but also improve their business. There is almost no analyst coverage of this name, so it tends to fly under the radar. There is no forward p/e because there are no estimates. In my opinion the company is around fair value, with potential to compound if it is able to grow in the snack food market.",creemeeseason,8,1677194177.0

They operate a diversified fleet of:

The question here is that i am making a worst case scenario, where, after the charters expire, all of the ships are scrapped. 

Of course this depends on steel prices, but with a total deadweight tonnage of 1.8 million how much do you think this can be scrapped for?

Adjusted operating income margins exceeded 40%, which puts Zoominfo in a rare category of meaningful profitability among higher-growth technology companies. But the key issue with last evening‚Äôs financial report had to do with its outlook: 2023 is only projected to grow at high teens. Not bad for any company to be forecasting double digit growth in a recessionary environment, but expectations for Zoominfo had been higher, especially in the light of historical performance.

&#x200B;

Key Highlights from Q4 2022 Report

The technology sector has been laying off employees since early-to-mid 2022 to reduce overheads and prepare for potentially weaker business volumes. Even giants like Salesforce (CRM -2.15%‚Üì) and Meta (META -2.25%‚Üì) could not avoid the fate as recessionary pressures continued unabated and markets demanded to see higher profitability.

&#x200B;

With 40% of its customer base originating from the software vertical and a largely seat-base revenue model, Zoominfo faced increasingly stacked odds in 2022. While it had enjoyed extraordinary growth in tandem with prevalent hiring in the technology sector back in 2021, those tailwinds recently turned into headwinds. Trying to retain accounts and win new ones when customers (exiting and potential) were retrenching became a tall order.",compassionatebecki,5,1678407220.0

stocks,118xerg,"The Overlooked, Beaton Down SAAS Stock - Dropbox (DBX)","# Introduction

For starters, this will be a smaller position in my portfolio. I do not think this company is the next Apple or Amazon. But, I think putting some capital into this company is attractive at these prices. I would love some constructive criticism here on what I may or may not be missing. I could make this post 5x longer going over the details of the business, but this is already long enough.

**What are some risks I may have missed?**

**What are some attractive traits I am not noticing?**

**Should a SAAS business with the given qualities of Dropbox trade at a \~9 P/FCF?**

**Should I make this a large/small position?**

# Why I Bought

I recently started a position in Dropbox (DBX) as I believe it has a compelling opportunity for ample returns over the next few years. The business qualities are what I would consider to be ""ok"" but not extraordinary by any means.

The pros are that it's a Subscription based business with reasonably low churn. Top-Line & Bottom-Line growth has been Consistent since IPO. Shares Outstanding have been decreasing for the last few years. Additionally, they have been expanding their product lines to try and increase their moat.

The cons are, the business has a smaller TAM than most tech giants. The moat/stickiness of the product is not very strong. I also think their pricing power is rather low.

The one incredibly attractive part of this story is the valuation. They have grown revenue and profits on a consistent basis for years. They are still projecting around **5%-10% top & bottom line growth this year.**

The company consistently trades at a perpetually low valuation due to the threat of big tech ""Always around the corner."" While it is possible for their products to be replaced, Dropbox has continually carved out a segmented market of its own. **The stock is still below its IPO price of almost 5 years ago despite consistent growth.**

The company projects a midpoint of $840M for 2023. If the company is currently trading at a 7.55B valuation, then that means their current **2023 P/FCF is at \~8.99.**

Lastly, the company is currently buying back around \~7.5% of the company's market cap annually. This could go as high as **+10% of the stock stays in the low 20s.**

While the company does not have the most superior metrics in the world, at what point does the cheap become TOO cheap. I can't resist buying a SAAS company at a \~8.99 P/FCF. **What are your thoughts?** Thanks.",jordanw71,7,1677070107.0

stocks,117ph53,Anyone believe in a NKLA jump after earnings call?,"Zack‚Äôs currently ranks Nikola Motor as a buy. Forecasted at a median target price of $5, double their current price, an average of $6.71 and a projected high of $15.

Nikola has a working product in the BEV semi and has been producing hundreds of trucks, with the FCEV model being launched this year with hundreds pre-ordered already.

Nikola named a new CEO this quarter who has decades of industry experience including CFO of Mitsubishi, CFO of Volkswagen Group, and CEO of Opal.

This quarter it was announced Nikola received California‚Äôs CARB benefits eligibility which provides sales incentives of $240,000 to $280,000 per truck. As well as eligible for a $40,000 clean commercial vehicle tax credit from the federal government.

Phase 3 of their factory in Arizona is nearing complete with the ability to increase production to 20,000 trucks per year at that factory not including their joint venture with IVECO factory in Germany.

Nikola also launched their hydrogen business HYLA. Dedicated to procuring, producing and distributing hydrogen fuel for truck.

Is there a strong case that Nikola is worth more than its current share price?

stocks,116slj2,Question About Good Faith Violations (non-margin/cash account),"With a cash account (no margin), let‚Äôs say someone want to make 1 swing trade per day, every single day using their full account balance.

Scenario:  
$10,000 account  
On Monday I sell $10,000 worth of AMZN to purchase $10,000 of AAPL  
On Tuesday I sell all shares of AAPL to purchase $10,000 of TSLA  
On Wednesday, I sell all TSLA shares to purchase $10,000 of GOOG

In this scenario, I would incur a good faith violation, correct? Because I used the proceeds of a sale to purchase another security and then sold the newly purchased security before the original funds used to make that purchased had settled? Or am I incorrect?

Most of my accounts are margin accounts, but I have 1 non-margin account that I am interested in doing this type of daily swing trading in and I'm trying to understand how good faith violations work and if this is possible without incurring violations.

stocks,1166fgz,Should I have been paying taxes on American stock dividends?,"Listen, I get confused and overwhelmed with taxes and finances and it makes me want to curl up and cry. I should have asked for help ages ago, but instead avoided it. 

Situation: Canadian citizen with American stocks from a previous employee share program (from within Canada). I only ever filed Canadian taxes. I left that job, so no longer contribute to buying shares or have done anything to those accounts; but they do obviously fluctuate and I get emails saying anywhere from $15-30 interest/dividend has been paid. I pay almost zero attention to them. I am now living in the U.K. When I used to file my Canadian taxes, I never declared any foreign investments. I never received any payments to my Canadian accounts from those stocks and never sold any shares - so I never considered that was potentially required. In the back of my mind I‚Äôve been worried I‚Äôve done something wrong and owe taxes for all those years. But I have no idea how stocks and dividends etc work - might as well be a foreign language to me. Again- this was all done and set up through my employer - I had nearly no responsibility other than saying yes I would like to contribute. 

I‚Äôve tried to look around and log into my accounts to help me understand. When people talk about a brokerage - my stocks are held with E-Trade (if that‚Äôs right?). So I suppose the ‚Äúdividends‚Äù I get emailed about are just paid into the account there that shows my whole balance? I can see there are tax forms there - which makes my heart sink, and hence posting for advice on Reddit. 

Can anyone be so kind as to try to put this in laymen‚Äôs terms for me to understand if I need to - and how to - pay back tax on previous years?? (And is this on my Canadian tax returns?) thank you so kindly in advance.",purple_pistachios,7,1676799445.0

# [Stock futures tick higher as Wall Street tries to rebound from a rocky week: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/12/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)
*****
> U.S. stock futures were slightly higher Monday as traders tried to regain their footing following the S&P 500‚Ä≤s and Nasdaq Composite‚Äôs worst weekly performances in nearly two months.

> S&P 500 futures rose 0.33%. Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 57 points, or 0.17%, while Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.61%.

> All three major indexes ended the week on a downturn. The Dow ended the week down 0.17%. The S&P 500 fell 1.11%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq slid 2.41%, marking their biggest weekly losses since December.

> These losses came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that there is still a long way to go in the fight against inflation. Powell also noted that interest rates could rise more than markets anticipate if inflation numbers do not abate, reversing some of the prior market optimism that rate hikes would soon ease.

> ‚ÄúThe risk, however, is that premature easing in financial conditions, and in turn, a pick up in growth expectations, may be counterproductive from an inflation fighting point of view. Indeed, post the hot January payrolls report, a number of Fed speakers this week have talked up rates expectations, pushing back on Powell‚Äôs dovish talk.‚Äù Barclays analyst Emmanuel Cau wrote in a Friday note. ‚ÄúAs a result, the disconnect between the Fed‚Äôs own rates forecasts and market pricing has noticeably narrowed, which has hurt US equities.‚Äù

> Investors are watching out for the consumer price index numbers on Tuesday for insight into the pace of inflation, as well as retail sales data.

> The final leg of earnings season also continues next week, with Coca-Cola, Marriott, Cisco, Marathon and Paramount set to report.

*****
> Stocks tumbled Friday as tech-focused lender Silicon Valley Bank shut down following losses in its bond portfolio, prompting the biggest bank failure since the global financial crisis and sending shockwaves through the banking sector.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped for a fourth consecutive day, finishing 345.22 points lower, or 1.07%, to close at 31,909.64. The S&P 500 lost 1.45% to settle at 3,861.59. The Nasdaq Composite shed 1.76% to end at 11,138.89.
*****
> All the major averages capped off the week with losses. The Dow fell 4.44% to post its worst weekly performance since June. The S&P dropped 4.55%, while the Nasdaq lost 4.71%.
*****
> Regulators took control of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday, after shares tumbled Thursday and the bank struggled on Friday to find another company to buy it. Regional bank stocks tumbled in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank‚Äôs demise, with the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF lost nearly 4.4%. For the week, the regional bank fund lost about 16%, its worst week since March 2020 as the pandemic hit.
*****
> ‚ÄúYou had a major U.S. bank collapse, the biggest bank failure since 2008, inevitably that‚Äôs going to spook the market,‚Äù said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer of Defiance ETFs. The failure, she added, is also fueling concern among investors over whether the contagion spreads beyond SVB.
*****
> Several bank stocks were repeatedly halted on Friday, including First Republic, PacWest and c/rypto-focused Signature Bank. First Republic dropped 14.8%, and PacWest shed 37.9%. Some bellwether bank stocks suffered smaller losses even as SVB‚Äôs fallout wreaked havoc on regional names. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America fell 4.2% and 0.9% respectively. JPMorgan held onto a 2.5% gain.
*****
> ‚ÄúThis is gamebook play, where traders and shorter term investors don‚Äôt want to be long over the weekend,‚Äù said Rich Steinberg, chief market strategist at The Colony Group.
*****
> The turmoil among bank stocks overshadowed a February jobs report, which gave some hints that inflation could be slowing. Payrolls increased more than expected, but investors focused on the smaller-than-expected gain in wages, which may cause the Federal Reserve to rethink its aggressive stance on rate hikes.

> # But the unemployment rate rose ‚Ä¶
> Yes, the unemployment rate rose to 3.6%, up from 3.4% in January. However, that was entirely for positive reasons.

> The unemployment rate, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measures it, is the number of people unemployed who are looking for work divided by the size of the labor force. Last month, the number of unemployed people that are looking for work rose by about 240,000. However, that‚Äôs because 419,000 people ‚Äúentered‚Äù the labor force, i.e., started looking for work. That‚Äôs a sign of a healthy labor market. People will start looking for work only if they think they can get a job.

> The labor force measure has issues related to how participation is measured ‚Äì they count someone as being in the labor force only if someone is looking for work. But a lot of people may not do so for any number of reasons, including not feeling confident in the job market or non-economic reasons like not having access to childcare. The measure also can fall over time because of a lot of retiring baby-boomers.

> One way to get around these issues is to look at the employment-population ratio for prime age workers, i.e., workers aged 25-54 years. This measures the number of people working as a percent of the civilian population ‚Äì think of it as the opposite of the unemployment rate, and because we use prime age, you get around the demographic issue as well.

> The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio just hit 80.5%, which is close to the highest level we‚Äôve seen in a couple of decades.

> It helps to recall that we just had a multi-generational black swan event in the form of a pandemic. But once everything re-opened, the expectation was that things would bounce back immediately. And a lot of numbers did, including GDP, employment, and consumption.

> However, there were also a lot of people who left the labor force amid the pandemic. And what we‚Äôre seeing now is that each month there‚Äôs a continuous flow of people back into the labor force, and these people are finding jobs quickly. Just over the past six months, 1.5 million more people have come into the labor force as prospects for finding a job improve.

> Make no mistake, this is a really strong labor market in my opinion.

> # Is the labor market too strong?
> It‚Äôs weird to even ask that question, but it matters for the Federal Reserve. In their model for the economy, they see a tight labor market as one that results in stronger wage growth. And strong wage growth can drive demand higher, pushing up prices and inflation.

> Well, hopefully, they can rest a little easy on that front. Average hourly earnings rose just 0.2% in February. Over the past three months, wages have been growing at an annualized pace of 3.6%, well below the 6%+ pace we saw last year. It‚Äôs getting very close to the pre-pandemic pace of 3.1%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-10-ahe-3m-change-1212x1600.png))**

> This backs up other evidence that wage growth is indeed easing, including the Employment Cost Index, which is the gold standard of wage growth measures. The ECI was running at an annualized pace of 4.2% in Q4 2022, down from 4.8% in Q3. The January-February hourly earnings data suggest that wage growth continues to decelerate.

> The big question is whether the Fed buys this. Powell‚Äôs comments this week in front of Congress did not inspire confidence. It looks like a string of hot economic data has left them questioning their decision to ease the pace of rate increases from 50 bps to 25 bps (as of February) ‚Äì and wondering if they should move that back up to 50 bps at their March meeting. At this point, markets think the outcome is a coin toss, which is not great as Powell simply injected maximum uncertainty into markets.

> But looking beyond the Fed‚Äôs March meeting, the big picture is that the labor market appears to remain really strong. This means the economy also remains strong, and that‚Äôs not a bad thing as far as markets are concerned. Though it also means the Fed is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer.

*****

> # Panic! At the Fed?

> Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs comments this week during his semi-annual testimony in front of Congress did not inspire much confidence with respect to the path for monetary policy. It seems like Fed officials‚Äô are confused as to what they want to do next.

> Case in point: last month, Powell said that the ‚Äúdisinflationary process has started.‚Äù

> Since then, we‚Äôve had a run of strong economic data, including January payrolls, retail sales, and inflation. And it looks like that was enough to spook the Fed. The shift was clear in Powell‚Äôs statements this week:

> ‚ÄúInflationary pressures are running higher than expected at the time of our previous Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.‚Äù

> And

> ‚ÄúThe ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated.‚Äù

> At the same time, he also said:

> ‚ÄúIf ‚Äì and I stress that no decision has been made on this ‚Äî if the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.‚Äù

> Markets were clearly taken aback by his comments, with equities falling 1.5% on Tuesday (March 7th) and rate hike expectations rising.

> This becomes clear if you look at expectations for their March meeting. Last Friday, markets were expecting a 0.25% increase in the federal funds rate, pricing the probability of that at 72%.

> That‚Äôs shifted significantly since Powell‚Äôs comments this week. Investors moved the probability of a 0.25% increase down to 28%, and the probability of a 0.50% increase rose to almost 80%.

> This is a huge shift, especially this close to a meeting. Typically, the couple of weeks prior to the meeting is a ‚Äúquiet period,‚Äù where Fed officials don‚Äôt give speeches or comments, i.e., anything that may lead to a shift in expectations. The last time this happened was in June 2022, when the Wall Street Journal reported that the Fed was considering raising rates by 0.75% instead of the 0.50% they guided markets toward.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-March-rate-hike-expectations-1202x1600.png))**

> # There‚Äôs not much reason to panic
> To be clear, the January data was hotter than expected. But this is just one month of data and is likely a rebound from the relatively soft December data (which, at the time, led to increased recession calls) and perhaps positive weather-related effects.

> We‚Äôre yet to get February data, but it‚Äôs hard to believe the string of hot data continues into February and March.

> Take vehicle sales, for example. Sales surged 19% in January to a 15.9 million annualized pace, the highest since May 2021. But sales pulled back to 14.9 million in February. So the trend is still positive, but nothing suggests that the economy is overheating to the extent that the Fed has to up-end market expectations for upcoming policy.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-auto-sales.png))**

> The Carson Investment Research team has been in the camp that the economy will avoid a recession this year. As we‚Äôve discussed before, we believe consumers are in good shape, and real incomes are rising, which should keep consumption humming along.

> This gets to the point that we don‚Äôt see the Fed cutting rates any time soon. Expectations for the terminal rate, i.e., the highest rate the Fed will get to, also rose this week. At the beginning of the year, investors expected the terminal rate to end up around 4.9%. That‚Äôs now increased to about 5.6% on the back of strong economic data.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-rate-expectations-1202x1600.png))**

> The good news is that, at the end of the day, positive economic data is positive. This perhaps explains why equities have remained resilient this year. The S&P 500 is up just under 4% year-to-date, despite rate expectations repricing higher.

> That‚Äôs a big shift from last year and a positive one. And we believe equities have the potential to remain resilient, even as the economic data (and the Fed) swing back and forth.

*****

> # This Doesn't Happen Often

> After a surge earlier this week that took the yield on the two-year US Treasury up above 5% for the first time since 2007, concerns over the health of bank balance sheets have caused a sharp reversal lower. From a closing high of 5.07% on Wednesday, the yield on the two-year US Treasury has plummeted to 4.62% and is on pace for its largest two-day decline since September 2008. Remember that?

> A 45 basis point (bps) two-day decline in the two-year yield has been extremely uncommon over the last 46 years. Of the 79 prior occurrences, two-thirds occurred during recessions, and the only times that a move of this magnitude did not occur either within six months before or after a recession were during the crash of 1987 (10/19 and 10/20) as well as 10/13/89 when the leveraged buyout of United Airlines fell through, resulting in a collapse of the junk bond market. As you can see from the New York Times headline the day after that 1989 plunge, just as investors are worrying today over whether we're in for a repeat of the Financial Crisis, back then they were looking at 'troubling similarities' to the 1987 crash. The year that followed the October 1989 decline wasn't a particularly positive period for equities, but a repeat of anything close to the 1987 crash never materialized.

> # 50-DMAs Couldn't Hold

> Worries about banks today left major US index ETFs across the market cap spectrum back below their 50-day moving averages. The uptrend channels that have been formed over the last six months are also getting tested with this week's move lower. You can see the current set-ups in the snapshot from our Chart Scanner tool below.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/50days.png))**

> Looking at our Trend Analyzer, every sector ETF except for Technology has now moved back below its 50-day moving average. Six of eleven sectors are actually oversold (>1 standard deviation below 50-DMA), with Financials (XLF) and Health Care (XLV) at ""extreme oversold"" levels. XLF had been up more than 8% on the year about a month ago, but it's now down 1.93% YTD.

> Technology (XLK) and Utilities (XLU) are the only two sectors up over the last week. Interestingly, Utilities (XLU) has been one of the worst performing sectors so far this year, while Tech has been the best.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/ussectoretfs.png))**

> With Financials seeing such a sharp decline this week, below is a snapshot of various banks and brokers in the sector with the ones highlighted in red all now trading at least 5% below their 50-DMA. As shown, Charles Schwab (SCHW) is down the most over the last week with a decline of 12.6%, which has left it 16.4% below its 50-DMA and down nearly 20% on the year. Other names like Bank of America (BAC), JP Morgan (JPM), and Raymond James (RJF) are in extreme oversold territory as well. Of the major banks and brokers listed, Goldman Sachs (GS) has actually held up the best over the last week with a decline of just 2%.

> # Bearish Sentiment Remains

> The S&P 500's swings higher and then lower over the past week have left sentiment little changed. For the American Association of Individual Investors' (AAII) weekly survey, 24.8% of respondents reporting as bullish compared to 23.4% the previous week. That is the second higher reading in a row but still well below the recent high of 37.5% from one month ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-1.png))**

> Along with a modest bounce in bullishness, bearish sentiment has taken a modest decline falling from a recent high of 44.8% last week down to 41.7% today. That is the first decline in a month, leaving it in the middle of its range since the start of last year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-2.png))**

> Given the moves in bullish and bearish sentiment, the bull-bear spread remains skewed in favor of bears for the third week in a row.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-3.png))**

> Following a sharp eight percentage point decline last week, neutral sentiment has bounced rising to 33.4%. Albeit higher, outside of last week, that reading would be the lowest since the end of 2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-4.png))**

> Although recent weeks have seen the AAII survey return to deeply bearish sentiment, other surveys are not nearly as pessimistic. While the AAII survey's bull-bear spread sits well over a standard deviation below its historical average, the NAAIM Exposure index continues to show only modestly long positioning among active managers. Currently, that reading is 0.2 standard deviations below the historical norm. Meanwhile, the weekly Investors Intelligence survey is actually showing respondents are reporting as more bullish than has been historically normal.

> # A Closer Look at Seasonality

> We talked a lot about how February (especially the second half of February) could be a potential break for stocks, well the good news is that we now see many signs of better times potentially coming soon.

> Here‚Äôs what the average year for the S&P 500 looks like. Looking at the chart below, the blue line shows gains from January through April, and November and December are normal. It is the middle part of the year that stocks tend to struggle.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-164.png))**

> Lately, things look a little different. Looking at only the past 20 years showed that stocks tended to bottom in March. This is likely due to major bear market lows taking place during this month in 2003, 2009, and 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-273.jpg))**

> We‚Äôve shared before that pre-election years tend to be strong for stocks, lower only twice going back to World War II and up nearly 17% on average, making this historically the strongest year of the 4-year Presidential cycle. Looking at these years it is once again common to see the second half of February weakness and a tradeable low in late February.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-321.jpg))**

> Building on this, we found that pre-election years of a new President do even better, up close to 20% on average. But wouldn‚Äôt you know it, right about now tended to be a consolidation period before late March and April strength.

> What about years that started off with big gains? When stocks gained more than 5% in January (like 2023) we found that a consolidation period took place now and into April. The good news is that eventual gains of close to 23% on average were how things ended up, suggesting any potential consolidation here could potentially be used as an opportunity.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-599.png))**

> Lastly, I‚Äôve seen other places combine many of the things I‚Äôve just discussed and make one composite combining them all. I did that and we called it the Carson Cycle Composite. This proprietary composite looks at the average year, pre-election years, pre-election years under a new President, the past 20 years, and years that had a 5% January. As you can see, this year started off stronger, but as of early March is right in line with what the average composite looks like. Take note, a gain of 15.6% is what has been the average Carson Cycle Composite.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-640.png))**

> The bottom line is many cycles suggest the potential for some type of a consolidation here and now would be perfectly normal, but the likelihood of strength before the end of the year is quite strong.

stocks,119kybj,"Important days ahead. A bit of economy basics for this week, 23th February and 24th. GDP, 4th Quarter and Year 2022 review and PCE January.","**GDP**

Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022 (table 1), according to the ""advance"" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the third quarter, real GDP increased 3.2 percent. 

**This will be reviewed tomorrow we will have a more accurate value.** 

**PCE**

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pce.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pce.asp)

Key points: 

* Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) is a measure of consumer spending.
* PCE is constructed and reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, along with personal income and the PCE Price Index (PCEPI) in the Personal Income and Outlays report.
* PCE includes how much is spent on goods (durable and non-durable) and services.
* **The PCEPI is the method used by the Federal Reserve to measure inflation.**
* **The PCE figures can affect decisions about business offerings, hiring, and investments.**

**What Is the Importance of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Number?**

The personal consumption expenditures number shows how Americans collectively spend their money. Tracked from month to month, it is an indicator of the health of the economy overall. It also is a key component of the PCE Price Index, which tracks inflation or deflation in consumer prices over time.

Specifically, the categories represented in PCE data include the following:

* Durable goods: motor vehicles and parts, furnishings and durable household equipment, recreational goods and vehicles, and other durable goods.
* Nondurable goods: food and beverages purchased for off-premises consumption, clothing and footwear, gasoline and other energy goods, and other nondurable goods.
* Services: housing and utilities, health care, transportation services, recreation services, food services and accommodations, financial services and insurance, and other services.

**Fed Preference for the PCE Price Index**

In 2012, the PCE Price Index became the primary inflation index used by the U.S. Federal Reserve when making monetary policy decisions. The Fed prefers the PCEPI over the comparable [Consumer Price Index (CPI)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/04/102004.asp), because, in summary:

* The PCEPI better reflects changes to consumer spending, such as selecting substitute goods due to price changes.
* It covers a broader range of spending.
* Past information can be adjusted to support recent information.6

The PCEPI is also weighted by data acquired through business surveys, which tend to be more reliable than the consumer surveys used by the CPI. Also, PCEPI uses¬†a formula that allows for changes in consumer behaviour and¬†changes that occur in the short term.7

**Last review:** 

The $41.6 billion decrease in current-dollar PCE in December reflected a decrease of $95.0 billion in spending for goods and a $53.4 billion increase in spending for services (table 3). Within goods, decreases were widespread and led by gasoline as well as motor vehicles and parts. Within services, the largest contributors to the increase were spending for housing, transportation (mainly air transportation), and health care. Detailed information on monthly PCE spending can be found on [Table 2.3.5U](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&step=3&isuri=1&select_all_years=0&nipa_table_list=2014&series=m&first_year=2020&last_year=2022&scale=-99&categories=underlying&thetable=). 

So basically, less expenditure in goods that is passing to no durable goods,  mainly gasoline and gas.

I am 26 years old and I am currently in the middle of restructuring my investments across accounts and need some advice! I have 3 investment accounts that hold about $80k+/- in total. 
$60k of that is invested  through Vanguard in a mixture of a traditional IRA, Roth IRA, and an i401k account. These accounts mainly hold Large Cap growth/value/total work market ETFS such as VTI, VOO, VIGAX, VVIAX, etc. etc. 

The other $20k is a personal TDA account I have traded individual stocks with since I was 18. This account holds a mixture of 10-12 individual stocks and has performed quite well over the years. 

My idea is to take this individual account and make a sectors play for fun and restructure the sectors every year as needed while contributing my Vanguard passively over time. 

I want to split the TDA account into 5 sectors:

1. TECHNOLOGY (SOXQ)
2. ENERGY (ICLN / XLE)
3. HEALTHCARE (XLV)
4. FINANCE (XLF)
5. STAPLES (XLP)

Is this a stupid play? Should I just liquidate my personal TDA account and just contribute it all to my retirement account? Thoughts?",Devincc,6,1676575494.0

stocks,113fyjs,Options for Investing Inheritance,"So my fianc√© a few years ago received an inheritance from a family member. Currently the total is about 100k with about 1/3 invested in S&P, 1/3 in a dividend etf, and 1/3 in a stable market fund (currently returning about 4.65%). The stable fund is more so we can buy a house one day, at least use some of it as a down payment. I‚Äôm 32 and she is 28, so both still fairly young. We both make ok money, about $100,000 a year combined and live in a city in the US Southeast so pretty low cost of living. We will continue to put money in the account; however, I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôll ever on our own make enough to massively pump the account so I want what we are starting with to help do a lot of the heavy lifting. So my question is if you were in our situation would you A) use a large portion of this in dividend stocks/etf, let it reinvest dividends, and then the new money we put in invest it in everything else in our portfolio and just let this grow off earnings alone (logic being this would help supplement how much we‚Äôre able to contribute each year) B) Invest in something with a higher risk reward (nothing like Bitcoin, but maybe a growth etf once this silliness in the market is over) C) Split it between Nasdaq, S&P, and Dow, D) anything you can think of.

*****
> U.S. stock futures slipped Wednesday following the release of January‚Äôs hotter-than-anticipated consumer price index.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures lost 83 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively.
*****
> The Dow fell during the trading session and closed lower by more than 156 points. The S&P 500 remained relatively flat, dropping 0.03%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shook off earlier losses to close 0.57% higher.
*****
> Inflation data for January came slightly above economists‚Äô estimates, indicating a potentially longer path in the Federal Reserve‚Äôs fight against rising prices. The consumer price index increased by 0.5% for the month and 6.4% from the prior year, compared to estimates of 0.4% monthly and 6.2% annually, according to Dow Jones‚Äô survey of economists.
*****
> Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, noted that while inflation remains above the Fed‚Äôs target rate of 2%, the higher-than-expected numbers weren‚Äôt entirely surprising.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe inflation came in with expectations, and I think that‚Äôs why the market took it in stride,‚Äù he said on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell: Overtime.‚Äù Commenting on the monthly uptick in inflation data, Yardeni added, ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre going to have some bumps along the road. But all in all, I think we are certainly seeing strong disinflation.‚Äù
*****
> However, he added that despite anticipating a soft landing for the economy, he doesn‚Äôt expect the Fed to cut interest rates this year.
*****
> Biogen and Kraft Heinz will be reporting their quarterly earnings on Wednesday before the bell.
*****
> Investors will also be looking toward the latest retail sales data to gauge consumer demand. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, industrial production and business inventories data will be released on Wednesday morning.

> Stock futures ticked higher Tuesday morning as investors looked ahead to key inflation data that may signal what the Federal Reserve will do at its March meeting.

> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 72 points, or 0.21%. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.31%, and Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.37%.
*****
> Stocks are coming off a positive session, with all three major indexes ending Monday‚Äôs session up more than 1%. That marked a turn from last week, when the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 posted their worst weekly performances since December.
*****
> Investors were largely positioning ahead of the consumer price index reading for January set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET Tuesday. The CPI is a gauge of inflation that tracks changes in prices across a broad basket of items.
*****
> Economists polled by Dow Jones expect CPI rose 0.4% from December, and climbed 6.2% compared to the prior year. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, is expected to rise 0.3% from the prior month and 5.5% on the year.
*****
> ‚ÄúAll eyes are laser-focused on Tuesday‚Äôs CPI report to gauge the market‚Äôs likely flight course for the balance of Q1 and beyond,‚Äù said Greg Bassuk, CEO at AXS Investments.
*****
> CPI declined 0.1% in December on a monthly basis, its biggest drop since 2020. It was a welcome sign to investors that inflation cooled and ignited hopes that the Federal Reserve would consider pausing its interest rate hikes.
*****
> Investors will be watching Tuesday‚Äôs reading for the same signs, Bassuk said. Market observers expect the S&P 500 could swing in either direction following the release of the data.
*****
> ‚ÄúTuesday‚Äôs CPI report, if fierier than expected, could jolt investors and the equity markets, which have been on a growth tear in 2023, sparked by hopes of declining inflation and a more dovish Fed policy on interest rates,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA reverse course from the recent months of disinflation would reignite investor concerns that high inflation and Fed rate hikes will define the markets in 2023 as they did last year.‚Äù
*****
> Beyond the CPI, investors will also be watching for earnings from Restaurant Brands International and Airbnb for insights into the health of the consumer. Shares of Coca-Cola rose after the company beat Wall Street expectations for fourth-quarter revenue.

So, with growth stocks back on investors‚Äô radar, is either Lightspeed Commerce or BlackBerry an excellent buy right now?

 

## Lightspeed Commerce

Lightspeed Commerce offers cloud commerce solutions to unify online and physical operations. It also integrates multiple sales channels, global payments, and supplier networks into its platform, thus enhancing customer experiences. Earlier this month, the company reported its third-quarter earnings for fiscal 2023. Its revenue grew by 24% while its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) loss declined from $9 million to $5.4 million.

The expansion of consumer locations, average revenue per user growth, and higher gross transaction value expanded its top line. However, the company‚Äôs net losses rose from $65.5 million to $814.8 million, primarily due to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $748.7 million. Due to declining consumer spending, the company‚Äôs management expects headwinds in the near term.

Meanwhile, Lightspeed‚Äôs long-term growth prospects look healthy, as more enterprises are taking their businesses online amid the growing popularity of online shopping. The company is also adding new modules, venturing into new verticals, and growing payments adoption. The company earns around 96% of its revenue from recurring sources, stabilizing its sales.

Further, Lightspeed‚Äôs management is working on improving its profitability. It has streamlined its operations and integrated recent acquisitions,¬†which helped slash 10% of its workforce. Amid these cost-cutting initiatives, the company‚Äôs management expects to break even or post positive adjusted EBITDA by the next fiscal year. Despite its healthy growth prospects, the company trades at an attractive NTM (next 12-month) price-to-sales multiple of 2.7 and price-to-book multiple of 0.9.

## BlackBerry

BlackBerry is a Canadian technology company specializing in cybersecurity solutions and has a solid presence in the IoT (Internet of Things) space. Although the company has been under pressure over the last few months, its long-term growth prospects look healthy amid expanding IoT market. *Allied Market Research* projects the global IoT market to grow at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 19.7% through 2030.

With its design wins in safety-critical automotive solutions and general embedded domains, BlackBerry is well positioned to expand its market share in the IoT space. Its IVY platform could be a substantial growth driver in the coming years, as it standardizes data generated from various systems across different vehicles, thus helping third-party developers to deliver data-driven services.

Although the company has been losing its market share In the cybersecurity market, its rebuilding efforts are progressing on the right track, as its churn rate improved in the November-ending quarter. So, given its growth prospects, BlackBerry‚Äôs management expects its overall revenue to grow at a CAGR of 13% through 2027.

The company‚Äôs management expects its gross margin to expand by 100 basis points annually while breaking even in the next fiscal year. Also, the company is optimistic about posting positive EPS and cash flows in fiscal 2025. Meanwhile, the company trades at an NTM price-to-sales multiple of 3.3 and a price-to-book multiple of 1.7.

## Conclusion

Given their high growth prospects, I expect both companies to deliver higher returns over the next three years. However, I am more bullish on BlackBerry due to its multiple growth drivers.",Playful-Ad6687,5,1677738549.0

Raytheon Technologies Inc (RTX) is a leading aerospace and defense company that designs and manufactures a wide range of advanced technologies, including missiles, radars, sensors, and avionics. The company was formed in April 2020 through the merger of Raytheon Company and United Technologies Corporation.

Strong operating cash flow growth. Really the main metric in focusing in on. But the rest of the balance sheet is strong as well as growth in operating income. Obvious Top and bottom line numbers have been growing higher in comparison to the industry. Company relies on government contracts which is a risk, but with Ukraine/Russian war this continues to grow even with a democrat in office.

&#x200B;

Reata $RETA is a pharma company in the CNS space, currently waiting for PDUFA approval from FDA, expected before 28th February.

The CNS is a particularly difficult space for biotech to get FDA positive news.

1. In fact, after some research, knowledgeable scientists put the odds for $RETA on a 60/40 , basically a binary event, reflected by extreme high IV. Issues on $RETA arise by its cardiotoxicity.

I must add that this is a delayed PDUFA, in those cases the success rate grows historically to 70/30 .

Also, I must add that discussions are being held on a possible FDA shift of policy regarding CNS, meaning more drugs in this space receiving green light.

&#x200B;

I would place a bet at 40% odds if well rewarded. Well, this seems to be the case.

Let's see.

&#x200B;

2) First of all, the option chain is bearish, meaning market is expecting bad news.

[Option chain](https://postimg.cc/5jj0GhQd)

3) This also means that the bull case is less liquid = spreads are bigger = puts are cheaper than calls.

4) $RETA is currently trading $48.83

Where should it go in both cases ? And will be the bull case rewarded as the bear case ?

&#x200B;

BEAR CASE = PUTS

&#x200B;

$RETA has cash  only for the equivalent of 10$ / share. And that's where the stock price is gonna end in these cases. This means \~ 39 points drop.

Not a case you see everyday !

[PUTS option chain](https://ibb.co/sCvzdf8)

The image refers to the simulated (Theoretical options price on Thinkorswim ) value of the puts after a 38.83 points drop, precisely on the 28th February. If the news come before 28th, the values will be even bigger.

Suggested strike : 5 PUTS MAR17 for an upside of ...

&#x200B;

23x  = 2300 %

Every  $100 should give you $ 2220 .

Net of invested sum and net of commissions.

As you can see, 1 put costs 5$ (+commissions to your broker).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

BULL CASE = CALLS

&#x200B;

I need to add that the upside potential is much less clear than then downside.

RETA could very well explode to 100 or more.

Let's see the 89 stock price here.

&#x200B;

[CALLS option chain](https://ibb.co/wphqZGp)

We start to see the effect of illiquidity and the huge spreads. Hoping to be able getting filled at the mid (while on puts we hit the ask, certain to get a fill) , the best strike would be

75 CALL  MAR17 .

&#x200B;

Minimum capital required \~ $ 450

Upside : 6.7x = 670 % . $ 2550 net.

&#x200B;

Taking the bull side, for the same upside value rounded to 40 points, doesn't pay that much .

And requires much more capital invested.

&#x200B;

If we spent that minimum amount on puts and we took into account the probability of success,

for both cases, what would be the results ?

60/40 : 3996 vs 1530

70/30 : 2997 vs 1785

This encompasses how much better would puts be paid, in case of successful bet.

stocks,1139utl,GNTX- Gentex,"I own no position in this company, but it is on my watch list. This is presented just to spur discussion of different names.

Who are they?

Gentex has several products, but most well known (and their largest segment by far) is their self dimming mirrors. They control about 90% of the market for self dimming mirrors in automobiles. This product also makes up about 98% of revenues (more on that later). They also make fire protection equipment and aircraft windows.

What is their moat?

Auto dimming mirrors. That's pretty much the company as of now. While they are dominate in the market, self dimming mirrors are only in about 36% of light autos produced today. Gentex would love to see that number go up as the technology migrates into lower level cars. Controlling 90% of the market would make it a big challenge for another supplier to develop a significantly better technology that would make OEMs want to switch. Morningstar gives this a narrow moat rating, which I think is fair.

Where will their growth come from?

As discussed, wider use of self dimming mirrors would be a huge boon to the company. This is the easiest growth as it involves putting an existing product in more things. 

They have additionally been moving into aircraft windows. Their self dimming technology is used on the Boeing 787 and 777x. Due to the long cycle time of airframe designs, this is a limited field (they logged about 5% growth in this segment last year). However, if their windows make it into the next generation of narrow body aircraft, this could be a big runway. 

They also are breaking into medical devices. Using their lighting technology they have developed lights that adjust with a surgeons vision. This is a promising field that could diversify the company.

What are their risks?

Concentration is the biggest risk, in my opinion. Having so much of your revenue in one field can be ripe for disruption.  So far, no one has come close, but it is a risk. There could also be technology that replaces mirrors, such as cameras. Currently this is not allowed in the US, but some countries have allowed this. However, cameras are heavier and more expensive than mirrors, so it is not clear if OEMs want to change. Lastly, full self driving would eliminate the need for mirrors. I am of the opinion that full FSD, without the option for human control, is at least a decade away. As long as the option for human control exists, cars will need mirrors. So this is a long term risk, but not one that I am prepared to look at now.

Why is this company so great?

Gentex has a pristine balance sheet. They carry no debt as of right now and have great cash flows. ROE and ROIC are in the high teens, occasionally touching the low 20s. Gross margins are 33%, which actually went down a bit during the pandemic. They fund R&D, as well as pay a dividend and buyback shares. The current dividend is 1.7%. They consistently buy back shares and lower share count. The share count peaked in 2012 at 290 million, and is now down to 233 million. That is about a 23%  reduction in share count in 10 years. Not to shabby. 

&#x200B;

The last few years have been a little soft for Gentex, as auto production slowed during the semiconductor shortage. As a result the stock is a little beat down right now. Most fair value estimates are in the mid $30s, and its currently trading at $28.50, so possibly a slight discount. Most analysts hav this company growing EPS around 15% annually, which is solid growth from an established company. I am quite intrigued.",creemeeseason,4,1676498561.0
stocks,112hixx,Looking for critiques on my scan which looks for short term plays (1 to 4 weeks). What else can I look at to increase confidence?,"So I'm trying to come up with a scan that tells me short term bull/bear investment opportunities with a high degree of confidence.

I start with two filters that allow me to scan for high volume (100,000+) and high market cap ($500M+) stocks. The next two filters allow me to scan which stocks are above/below the 50 and 200 daily EMA (exponential moving average). For bears I set it to ""BELOW"" and for bulls I set it to ""ABOVE"".

Then I get fancy utilizing a script to scan an indicator called TTM\_Squeeze. You can learn more about this indicator from multiple youtube videos. I've kind of made my own strategy though.

# Fancy Pants Script

    # Histogram variables
    def hist_0 = TTM_Squeeze().""Histogram"";
    def hist_1 = hist_0[1];
    def hist_2 = hist_0[2];

    def SA_2 = SA_0[2];

    def SA_4 = SA_0[4];
    
    # Change in Histogram
    def delta_0 = hist_0 - hist_1;
    def delta_1 = hist_1 - hist_2;
    def delta_2 = hist_2 - hist_3;
    def delta_3 = hist_3 - hist_4;
    
    # SqueezeAlert condition
    def SAcon = SA_0 == 1 and
                SA_1 == 1 and
                SA_2 == 1 and
                SA_3 == 1 and
                SA_4 == 1;
    
    # Conditions for bear
    def falling  = delta_0 < 0 and
                   delta_1 < 0 and
                   delta_2 < 0 and
                   delta_3 < 0;
    def freefall = delta_0 < delta_1 and
                   delta_1 < delta_2 and
                   delta_2 < delta_3;
    
    # Conditions for bull
    def rising   = delta_0 > 0 and
                   delta_1 > 0 and
                   delta_2 > 0 and
                   delta_3 > 0;
    def rocket   = delta_0 > delta_1 and
                   delta_1 > delta_2 and
                   delta_2 > delta_3;
    
    #plot bear = SAcon   and 
    #            falling and 
    #            freefall;
    plot bull =  SAcon  and 
                 rising and
                 rocket;

Basically the script is looking for stocks that ARE NOT consolidating their price in the last 5 bars. That's the ""SAcon"" variable. Then for bears, it looks for stocks that have a falling Histogram value which is accelerating downward. For Bulls, it looks for stocks that have a growing Histogram value which is accelerating upward.

Here's what it gave me after closing today.

stocks,11mf7sy,Questions regarding options trading and relationship to stock price,"Hello All

I have been going over options and have used options sparingly in the past. I've read up on them to have a pretty good understanding of how they work and I had some questions that I'm hoping people might be able to shed some light on. I'm fairly sure the answers to these questions may depend on my intentions so I will try to give as much detail on my thought process behind the questions as I can. 

Most of my trading in the past has been strictly buying and selling the actual stock. Since I am not an active day trader who has time to be watching prices like a hawk, I usually do my research after hours, determine potential entry/exit prices and the like. 

Options are a bit confusing to me not in their actual function but rather how one can do price research after or before hours. Options have their own prices based on the strike price (in the money or out of the money) as well as expiration. I think the easiest way to illustrate my question is to give a scenario. 

Lets say I buy a single AMD call option for 1.40 with a strike price that is out of the money (lets say the price is 81 and I buy a call option for 84 dollars with an expiration of 10 days). The price of my options is 1.40, and it will move throughout the day back and forth. Below are a series of questions I have regarding this. For the purposes of the below questions, the trading I am speaking of just flat out buying puts or calls, nothing fancy. 

1. If my intention is to get into and out of an option contract within 2-3 days, is buying a 10 day expiration advisable given the theta values? And if I am going into it with such a short expiration, is it better buy in the money or out of the money? 

2. If I want to do my research after hours and put in an order so i can walk away and hope it fills the next day, can I still rely on the prices of each option set that is shown on w/e app I am using? Normally for actual stock price, I wouild look at the closing/opening price of AMD, look at the chart and some fundamentals and decide on a price for a limit buy order. Can I accomplish this same concept with options as well given how theta works with decay from day to day or can I really only rely on the point in time pricing of options. 

3. I wanted to dip my toe into options by using debit spreads since I could control my losses easier, however i dont have level 3 options trading on webull, but webull does allow you to place stop loss/take profit orders for options, this should in theory accomplish the same thing as a call debit spread without the benefit of a cheaper entry correct?

However, on a constant-currency basis, the growth stood at 26% amid solid organic growth, driven by higher ARPU (average revenue per user), GTV (gross transaction volume) growth, and increased adoption of its payments.

Compared to its previous year‚Äôs quarter, the company‚Äôs ARPU grew by 20% while its total customer locations grew by 5%. The company witnessed 15% and 19% growth in customer locations that processed GTV of over US$500,000 and US$1 million, respectively. However, the number of customer locations processing GTV of $200,000/year fell during the quarter.

Its net losses came in at US$814.8 million, including US$748.7 million of non-cash goodwill impairment charge compared to $65.5 million in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. However, its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) losses declined from US$7.1 million to US$5.4 million. As a percentage of revenue, its adjusted EBITDA fell from 4.7% to 2.7%, which is very encouraging.

Further, Lightspeed closed the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of US$838.1 million. So, the company is well positioned to support its growth initiatives.

## Lightspeed‚Äôs growth prospects

Amid the expansion of e-commerce, more SMBs (small- and medium-scale businesses) are taking their business online. This secular shift has created a multi-year growth potential for Lightspeed. Also, the company‚Äôs products aid in improving their productivity, lower expenses, automate specific processes, and provide data-driven insights.

With customer locations that process GTV of over US$500,000/year growing in double digits, Lightspeed would focus on bigger businesses, which offer a lower churn risk and higher lifetime value for the company. The company is adding new modules, improving its penetration, and expanding its verticals to grow its customer base and ARPU. With the company‚Äôs gross payment volumes forming a small percentage of its GTV, it has substantial scope for expansion. Further, the company earns around 96% of its revenue from recurring sources, stabilizing its financials.

Along with top-line growth, Lightspeed is focusing on improving its profitability. It has reorganized and streamlined its operation, slashing 10% of its workforce. It has successfully integrated its recent acquisitions,¬†which has helped lower its losses. Meanwhile, the company‚Äôs management has set a goal to achieve breakeven or positive adjusted EBITDA by the end of the next fiscal year. So, the company‚Äôs growth prospects look healthy.

## Bottom line

Although Lightspeed has witnessed healthy buying recently, it still trades at attractive multiples. The company‚Äôs NTM (next 12-month) price-to-sales and price-to-book multiples stand at three and one, respectively. Considering its deeply discounted stock price and growth prospects, I am bullish on Lightspeed, despite the near-term volatility. So, investors with an investment horizon over three years can start accumulating the stock to earn superior returns.",No_Cow1,3,1676955087.0

stocks,113fm89,What advice would you give someone who wants to invest everything in just TQQQ?,"As the stock geek in the friend circle of people who work in the tech sector, psychology, IT, etc (which I work in none of those fields btw just all of my friends do) I had a recent meet up with a few of these friends and they asked me how my portfolio was doing so far this last 2 years. I explained pretty good, because I got lucky with timing on leveraged ETFs. I made some money investing in SQQQ in 2022 (30% gain) because I knew the party of 2020/2021 was coming to an end. I also invested in OILU in 2022 in February because I knew oil was going to jump for months. 

One of my closer friends asked me about TQQQ. More specifically what would happen to a person's money (investment) if they invested $25k just in TQQQ today and did not touch their investment for many years. At first I answered ""that is like betting all on red at the roulette wheel"". Then I did the math again in my head and realized the only way a person could loose all of their money would be if in the future we had a day where the stock market dropped at least 33.3% in one day (since TQQQ is 3X leveraged). This is not possible because the circuit breakers would kick in at 7%, then again at 13%, then again at 20% (I believe after 20% the market would just close for that day). Also keep in mind TQQQ has rebalancing and decay. 

After giving it more thought I told my friend I would get back to him. He is adamant that we are near the market bottom, and even thinks we hit bottom late last year and that it would be good for a person in their early 30s to invest $25k in just TQQQ and not touch the funds for decades. I advised him to never invest in just one thing with that amount of money. It would be common sense to throw money in VOO, QQQ and maybe at most 15% of your portfolio in TQQQ. I would say it would be wiser to swing trade SQQQ and TQQQ but it would take a few hours each week to time things correctly - it would be easier mentally to just invest in TQQQ and leave it - if you can stomach the rollercoaster.",Dynasty__93,4,1676514444.0
stocks,112tcp3,The origins of this rally according to bloomberg,"Can someone explain to me what's happening with liquidity and if this is bullish or bearish?

&#x200B;

‚ÄúThe origins of this year‚Äôs risk rally lie in obscure technicals driving central bank liquidity,‚Äù King said in the report. ‚ÄúAt this point we think most of the boost to reserves is done.

&#x200B;

According to King, the $1 trillion increase in reserves helps resolve the disconnect: It‚Äôs worth about a 10% boost for stocks, 50 basis points of tightening in investment-grade credit spreads and 200 basis points for high yield spreads

&#x200B;

There have been four notable developments that account for the surge

&#x200B;

In the US, declines in usage of the Fed‚Äôs overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility and money held in the Treasury‚Äôs general account have pushed cash into the banking system

&#x200B;

European governments have similarly withdrawn hundreds of billions of euro deposits from their accounts at the ECB since August, bolstering liquidity.

&#x200B;

In Japan, reserves have risen by about $200 billion as a result of the central bank‚Äôs yield-curve control program

&#x200B;

while in China, the central bank‚Äôs ongoing liquidity operations amounted to about $400 billion in December alone, King said.

stocks,11m4xks,"$150K in Individual Brokerage, $14K in additional income and $6K additional in new ROTH IRA","Hi all, 

&#x200B;

I've been reading the Intelligent Investor by Graham and I've recently opened my eyes to small exposure to bond investing. 

&#x200B;

I know rate hikes have increased recently which means long-term maturity bonds might not be the best bet, but for the sake of diversity, I'm considering investing in some bond etfs. 

&#x200B;

Currently my account is as follows. 

1. 150,000 in SPY in individual brokerage account
2. 20,000 in bank account ready to invest, with 6500 ready to put in ROTH IRA and 13500 to add on to my individual brokerage account. 

&#x200B;

So here is my question: 

1. Given that Bond etf dividends are tax qualified, would it be better to invest in bond etfs in my ROTH IRA so I don't pay taxes on dividends? Then I can put the remaining amount of money in my non-tax advantaged account and keep buying SPY
2. Would it be better to just buy SPY & SCHD on my ROTH IRA, and rather have my small exposure of bonds to my non-tax advantaged account?

&#x200B;

However, with all my activity and continuing to add funds to this portfolio, I question how accurate the return figure is.

stocks,11f66hy,Is QQQ a better investment than SF Bay Area SFHs?,"I posted this on r/RealEstate too but I guess it's a different population there. Today I saw a post that kinda make me regret buying a home in the Bay Area in 2021. Basically the post claimed:

1. Cupertino, CA SFHs are strongly related to APPL stock price. Same as SF Bay Area housing price strongly related to QQQ price.
2. Cupertino Median SFH price went from 1.41m in 02/2013 to 2.45m in 02/2023, which is a 1m net increase. Assume we bought it with 280k downpayment and 6.3k monthly mortgage.
3. In Cupertino, 3 bedroom rent price has been around 4k in the past ten years. If we had choose to rent, put in that 280k downpayment in APPL stock back in 2013, and use the 2.3k monthly cash flow to invest in APPL, we would have ended up with a yearly return rate of 25%.

Since bay area housing price is strongly related to tech stocks, does this mean people should rent in the bay area?

Now I am feeling very bad about putting down a lot of cash in a 1.2m townhouse back in 2021, although at the time I thought it was a deal since the comparables sold for 1.35m. But again, is tech stock just a better investment than bay area houses?",_sparkle_eyes,2,1677683437.0

For context, capital maritime is a family run business owned largely by evangelos malinakis who is one of Greece‚Äôs richest men and is a celebrity there.

I have been doing research on them, but I just have a specific question regarding two 100M and 150M EUR bond issues in the last year and a half on the Athenian exchange.

The bonds were oversubscribed significantly with it being 3.5x and 5.5x oversubscribed, respectively.

Is this amount of oversubscribing common or was it largely because Greek investors feel that anything backed by evangelos malinakis has very good credibility?

I am wondering because they have a large amount of debt they may need to be refinanced one day through RCF creations, Term loans, or possibly bond issues.",Outside_Ad_1447,2,1677240542.0

stocks,11l9oui,"$Funko Company, a value play or a flop?","**Overview:** 

Funko is a pop culture lifestyle brand. They produce Funko Pop! figures, bags, wallets, board games, vinyl, and, recently, NFTs. They operate under the mission that everyone is a fan of ""something"". They have the most amount of licenses (over 1000 licensed properties) that allow them to use their content (Disney, Marvel, HBO, etc..+250 others)

Their fan base could be seen as very dedicated and active fan base. According to their annual report, 33% of their fans are hardcore collectors that own an excessive amount of collectibles. The brand is well known among the collectibles community, and ""Funko"" term is used to describe any pop culture figure. They also grow their brand by attending Comic Cons and focusing on social media. They also operate in a niche that no other direct competitors are following (more on that below)

The company has recently been getting lots of negative remarks from fans and analysts after reporting a net loss in 2022 and admitting to their plan of getting rid of 30-36 million worth of inventory (Dumping). The fans are currently furious as to why the excess inventory is not being donated, and investors are not happy with the mismanagement. Management explained that their forecasted inventory was not accurate, their ERP system is faulty, and a new one will be established with more money used this year.

**Company in numbers:** 

Even though the company reported one of its worst quarters yet, with negative profits due to an increase in production costs and inventory issues, its growth rates are still worth noting to understand the bigger picture: 

Return on invested capital 6yr average (since IPO): **27%**

Sales growth rate 6yr average: **24%**

EPS growth rate 6yr average: **27%**

**Year to Year numbers:** (From their annual letter)

Net sales increased by **28%** to 1.3B 

Net sales in the US increased by **30%** to 900M

Net sales in Europe increased by **22%**

Net sales in other (MENA, Asia, etc..) increased by **21%**

Net sales from their other brand Loungefly increased by **67%**

Top ten customers representing **44%**. 

No single customer accounted for over **10%** of revenue

Direct to consumer's sales flat at **11%**

These numbers show robust demand and a good return on acquisition since they bought Loungefly, a pop culture accessories brand. it also shows that their effort in Direct to Consumers sales is yet to be shown effective and needs further improvement. 

**Moat?**

I would argue their brand is one of their moats, their fans are obsessed with their original production. They also found a niche that no other direct competitor is investigating, hence they are the largest portfolio of licensed content in the pop culture industry with over 1000 licenses, 106 trademarks in the US, and 247 trademarks International. 

**Future & Risks?**

\-While the growing demand and their ability to yet penetrate other international markets sound optimistic, the management in the last earning reports alarmed investors that their inventory and warehouse issues would be fully solved by end of this year. This is also one of the risks as what if the newly implemented ERP fails once again? What if the company needs to compensate for renting extra spaces? Will the management be competent enough to avoid such issues in the future?

\-The seasonality of their products, even though they mention their products are not seasonal and have longer shelf time, their quarterly reports still show a stronger quarter towards the end of the year when buying gifts is on every consumer's mind. 

\-I see the demand for collectibles growing, and I find their mission of everyone being a fan of something quite promising as it is indeed true, and they are able to capitalize from it. Their future plans include more focus on Anime, Sports, and Music. Three areas they believe are underpenetrated. 

They are also trying to diversify their offerings, allowing them to step further from being seasonal products and having multiple streams of revenue. Their recent acquisitions have also supported this thesis: 

2017 Loungefly 

2019 Forrest-Pruzan (leading board game development studio)

2021 TokenWave LLC (NFT project) 

2022 Mondo Collectibles (a high-end collectible company that creates vinyl records, posters, soundtracks, toys, apparel, book, games, and other collectibles)

\-The company is very short on cash, currently **19M**, and could dilute shareholders to raise more capital in the future. 

**Stock:**

Currently trading at 9,26$. The stock was punished last week after quarterly reports and was down 22% until recovering back to 9$ per share.

It also seems to me that it is one of the companies that is misunderstood by investors; it could be the next beanie baby or it could be another fad. However, numbers and the company's effort to diversify argue against it. 

A large amount of institutional ownership **91.70%** 

Management is buying stocks but does not hold any significant shares.

Current Market Cap: 499M 

&#x200B;

**Competitors:** 

Hasbro ($HAS) is an American conglomerate that produces toys, board games, action figures, etc...

Mattel ($MAT) is another toy company; think of Barbie & Hot Wheels. 

It is worth noting that even tho both of these companies operate on a much higher level, they have yet to penetrate the same niche Funko is operating. As they focus more on kids rather than adults and pop culture. 

The only direct competitor I was able to witness is a small private company called Youtooz, creating very similar figures to Funko with much fewer licensing agreements and focusing more on Youtubers and individual celebrities.

I am a private investor based in Germany. I invested in some stocks in the beginning of the COVID epidemic. One of those was a US REIT company called STORE Capital Corporation. I used my bank depot for that, my bank is ING.

The REIT company was bought by GIC (Singaporean sovereign wealth fund) and the deal was finalized last month. So the REIT went private and all shares were taken out of the public stock market.

I asked them what is this and they told me it is a withholding tax charge of 21% from USA. However, it is not taxing my profits, but the entire amount. Which for me makes no sense. Their reply was:

stocks,11a52qh,Places to find good information on companies by their raw commodity and product output?,"Kind of like a stock screener but with the ability to sort and search by actual commodities and finished products. Seems everywhere I look the best you can do is sort by industry and sector and then just basic financial metrics.

&#x200B;

For example I'm currently researching a company that produces agricultural fertilizer by processing petroleum coke. So their raw input is petroleum coke and the finished product is urea ammonium nitrate fertilizer. That then gets sold to agricultural companies. Who then sell their products to grocery stores or restaurants...

&#x200B;

Which begs a lot of questions. How do they stack up against other urea ammonium nitrate fertilizer producers? At best I can find other similar companies but they may have tons of other business ventures and the best I can hope for is to sort by market cap, P/E, etc. It doesn't tell me practically anything about how they compare in the overall urea ammonium nitrate fertilizer market in terms of production output.

&#x200B;

Or how about the raw input of petroleum coke? I assume major oil refiners produce a whole bunch of it but again I have no idea about specifics. Who specifically makes the most of it? Who sells it cheapest? Are their different grades of it available at different price points? What does the overall market picture look like? Again pretty much the best I can hope for is to see market cap and P/E and the vast majority of that for major companies probably has nothing to do with the specific petroleum coke aspect of their business.

&#x200B;

Furthermore I know practically nothing about petroleum coke or urea ammonium nitrate. Are there uses for other industries? Are there closely related alternatives that have specific advantages or disadvantages? How about the Iron/Steel industry? Or aluminum. I'd love to learn more about raw Bauxite production or the different grades of steel and the demand for them as well as how this all ties in to industrial production of intermediate goods that wind up making their way in to finished products say to the construction or aerospace industries in this example.

&#x200B;

To flip it around what about who are the biggest consumers of certain raw materials? For an easy example think of how much of the annual US potato harvest company X buys up to make their french fries every year. That kind of thing.

&#x200B;

See what I'm getting at here? I realize this is kind of niche stuff but I find it really interesting and useful. Best I've been able to find is some random stuff on Wikipedia about X company being the largest or 2nd largest producer of Y commodity maybe even what percentage of global output they account for or a reference to their actual annual volume produced in tonnage or whatever if I'm super lucky and who knows how up to date and accurate that kind of stuff even is anyway.

&#x200B;

Anybody know of anywhere you can find information like this? Preferably in sortable databases or something? If not I may legitimately take a crack at making something myself especially if other people find the idea interesting.",Important-Drop614,1,1677177403.0
stocks,119l4yd,Schwab taxable account question please,"Hello! 2022 was my first year having a taxable account. I used to have a financial advisor (lol) then realized that was a mistake, so I switched to Schwab. 

In April ‚Äò22, I transferred over to Schwab. I ‚Äúsold‚Äù what my advisor had for me and the form has all the transactions. 

Taxable account balance is currently around $20k

My qualified dividends is $129.87.

Ordinary dividends $224.69

Section 199A dividends is $5.87 lol

My income is only $38k take home after all deductions. Single no kids 


Anyone have any idea roughly what I‚Äôll owe? 

I‚Äôm a beginner, so I‚Äôm definitely curious! The dividends amount. Is that the amount I owe? Or a percentage of the total amount? 

I know taxable account is last on the investment list but it doesn‚Äôt seem like I‚Äôll owe much? As well as, is it just all factored in with everything tax wise? Or do I owe just on this account then everything else is separate? My W2 etc? Or is everything factored in then what I owe or get back is based on the total of everything?

stocks,113yfnh,AKAM is a buy for me,"I use linode (Akamai cloud computing platform they acquired last year or so) and it is fantastic. With the cloud computing market at $484B, projected to triple in the next three years to over $1.5T, paired with Akamai's already existing edge computing resources which they can leverage to become even more competitive than linode's already competitive pricing, I see no where but up for the company. I think it is a solid buy for at least the long run, if not the short run due to further analysis on the part of fund managers already invested in cloud computing protecting their positions.

Re: recent drop due to headlines, Akamai moving to the cloud was already announced with the acquisition of linode and it sounds like it is just basing it's already existing profit centers (edge computing) in an amazing way... any sell offs at this point either know something I don't or are basing their trades on ill informed hunches.",jessie-farsi,0,1676574708.0

stocks,11nzi69,"Yellow Corporation (YELL), in the final stages of a 2023 operational turnaround & LTL logistics network transition to super-regional status.","(Good afternoon, I'd like to share this good faith investment insight/idea with everyone and get the word out on the company's recent improvements...thanks.)

&#x200B;

North America's fifth largest transportation company, Yellow Corp. (YELL), is in the midst of a major corporate/operational turnaround and positioning themselves exceptionally well for the future.  After watching the company for many years, I like what they've accomplished in the past year to two and am confident in their direction.  As announced in Feb, Yellow returned to profitability in 2022 and posted their best annual operating income & ratio in 16 years!  They operate the nation's 2nd largest LTL freight network (behind only FedEx Freight) and service every zip code in the U.S., with logistics routes also into Canada/Mexico.  Although they are a large company, do $5.2+ Billion in revenue and have over 30,000 employees...Yellow Corporation's current market cap is at a shockingly low level.  When compared to LTL trucking peers and including their significant real estate portfolio & equipment, YELL easily becomes one of the United States' most undervalued larger public companies.  Their estimated forward P/E is under 3, far below the industry standard.  In 2022, Yellow Corp also graduated over 1000 students from their homegrown CDL driving academies.  These drivers will increase capacity during the Spring/Summer months when demand is expected to increase across all LTL carriers.  LTL (less-than-truckload) is the most profitable category within the ground freight sector, fyi. 

&#x200B;

The company's network transition to super-regional status (completion expected over the next few months) is a huge step towards Yellow Corporation becoming more efficient/competitive and profitable.  This transition will speed up deliveries and significantly increase cost synergies & savings within the company.  Yellow's financial situation has begun improving, but it's not 'yet' being reflected in their common stock price (YELL).  It's rare to find a large company in such a promising turnaround situation (which still remains somewhat unknown), with extreme Undervaluation investment opportunity.  They have also started to pay down debt in large chunks, using a plan to sell off seventeen ""unneeded"" (duplicate) commercial real estate holdings - post network transition throughout 2023.  Reference their website and public filings for more detailed info.  \*Lastly, strongly recommend to take a few minutes and compare Yellow's future potential valuation to it's competitors (ArcBest, SAIA, Old Dominion, XPO Logistics, Knight-Swift, etc)!
