Paid for the entire wedding using the money gambled in the market which she did not contribute anything to. She refuses to acknowledge my in depth analysis/ Reddit research and says I‚Äôm just gambling out (actually mine) life savings everyday. Meanwhile she contributes nothing monetarily to the relationship and just spends everyday having Tea brunch and wine nights with her gals.

We recently went on our Honeymoon and she took away my phone so I couldn‚Äôt check the markets. She ended up finding my burner phone while I was in the shower after market close.

Long story short I took a loan against the house for a  Call option last Friday and because of JPow speech yesterday they have been margin called. The house is at risk if market doesn‚Äôt bounce back and she is a little upset. Says that if we lose the house that she will file for a divorce. Everything we own is because of my gambling.

11obkuc,"Why SVB is just the beginning, Analysis of the fall of SVB from a Financial Analyst","Ignore the headlines and news anchor, they don't really understand shit. But stuff is just about to kick off and I am going to help explain what is happening and will be happening in the coming weeks and months.

From the start of this fed cycle, I have been wondering who has been eating losses. Basic financial equation 101 teaches you that the present value of an asset is a function of the discount rate applied to its future cf or coupon rate. When the 10/30 year went from 1.5-2.0% in 2019-2021 to 4-5% this year, this meant the market value of those bonds would have fallen by close to 20-25%.

For example TLT, which is the 30 year teasury ETF, has fallen by about 21% in the LTM.

Most people don't understand the bond market in the US is the largest in the world, dwarfing the stock market. It is about twice the size of the stockmarket and is the deepest and most liquid securities market in the world. Within this market, the deepest and most liquid part of the market is made up of US treasuries and mortgage backed agency MBS securities.

https://preview.redd.it/nuaouidc91na1.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fd1df457bbc1c8521213d752cb72fcfdfc74edc8

With the sudden spike up in rates over the last 12-16 months, the mark to market losses of the bond market is probably somewhere to the tune of 4-6 trillion. And I have always been wondering where that was going to show up and blow something up in the financial market. And the answer is in the banks.

Don't believe what they tell you, Silicon Valley Bank was a very conservative bank. Out of their \~200 billion in assets, very little (<0.5%) was venture debt lending. As you can see in their Q4 Balance Sheet, they had 15 billion in cash/cash like securities, about 120 billion investment securities and 70 billion in loans.

https://preview.redd.it/1txj1mjma1na1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5db030273760e55e735cbe23f59f7bdc234c4ba6

within that 120 billion investment securities, it is almost entirely treasuries and Agency MBS/CMO and CMBS with a touch of muni bonds. You can't build a more conservative book if you tried. As these are all effective government securities as the GSEs are still in conservatorship under the treasury. For years due to Basel III, US banks have been derisking and now most of their balance sheets consists of government or quasi government securites which have almost no default risks.

https://preview.redd.it/lsa5410ab1na1.png?width=1383&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=08f812017cc1f95d3bb9744f7d63a150d9af5980

Now looking at the loan book, you can see the bulk of it is in global fund banking and investor dependent. Global Fund banking is an extremely safe segment, it consists of largely funding or bridging loans to venture capitalist making transactions. So for example if a VC  wants to invest in company A, but they want to wait 2 months before drawing down from their LPs, they will go to SVB to get a credit line for this purpose. This is an extremely safe business model as Venture/PE Funding is contracted funding and there has been basically no defaults on these types of loans ever in history. Then you have private bank, which consisted of lending to rich people over collateralized through the value of their houses, which is also a pretty safe business model as their asset coverage typically exceeds 150% of the loan value.

Even the investor dependent segment is typically very safe book, as they will write loans as simply a bridge when a financing round for the company has already closed, but are still waiting a few months for the all the papers to be signed and the funds to be transfered.

https://preview.redd.it/r44w54mdc1na1.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=398e0e9c28ff1ac7136629523f3d6097a2a899c6

So wtf is happening, this is a bank that is holding like 2/3 of its book in government papers and the rest in fairly safe lending. The speculative lending to early tech business represent <0.5% of the book.

The answer is the federal reserve, this guy

https://preview.redd.it/55mo4dswd1na1.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d709bd4f520d27a18147429f343a3a24ce45dcb3

He basically fucked over the entire banking sector. Remember that 120 billion in agency backed papers  and treasuries in the investment securities section of SVB , well, most of that is HTM (Hold to Maturnity). Its a bank, get over it, a duration mismatch is expected. But the amplitute of the loss is proportional to the raise in rates due simply how bonds work. In the SVB book, the average maturity is around 6 years. Some simple math point to about a 10% loss in this investment book that hasn't been marked to market, representing about 12 billion in losses. This wiped out all the equity of the bank and some of the  value of the bonds.

Overall the Agency papers and treasuries can be sold over the course of the next couple of weeks and depositers will get about 60 cents on the dollar and the remainder will be sold over the next 12-48 months and I expect most depositers to get back close to 90 cents + on the dollar.

Well that's great, you might say. NO, IT IS NOT GREAT. BECAUSE SVB was not a bad bank, it was actually a pretty conservative bank. It also wouldn't be insolvent if it wasn't for the fed. What it did suffer from was a unique deposit base that was largely not FDIC insured. Since it was largely catering to start-up companies, most accounts went above the FDIC limit of 250k, as a result, this was simply a bank run similar to during the great depression. It doesn't matter how safe the bank was, if there is a run, you won't survive it. And the uniqueness of start-ups which are most often cash burning and therefore extremely senstivie to the lack of cash just meant they were more flighty depositers. Marry that to the game theory dynamics of the low cost of getting your money out first so you can meet payroll mean't that once it starts, you can't stop it.

Ok, you ask, what the hell does it all mean for the future. Well, here is the thing. If SVB is underwater, are all the banks are underwater?

Here are the assets of JPM, again, for the major banks, JPM has a 3.5 trillion balance sheet, and BOA has a 3 trillion balance sheet. JPM only lists out 641 billion of that 3.5 trillion as trading securities and thus and they reported a loss of \~50 billion or \~8%.

This is a similar picture with BOA, which lists out trading securites of 300 billion, but there is another 2.7 billion in other assets, of which 1 trillion are longer dated treasuries and agency securities. If we mark to market those losses, there is another 80-100 billion in losses which are not being marked to market.

Again, going back to the original thought, someone lost 4-6 trillion through the bond market from fed raising rates. Close to 2 trillion is lost through agency securities with the reminder from treasuries. Unironically, close to 15% of this is lost from the fed itself, due to its own balance sheet of treasuries and agency papers. It looks like around 30% of those agency security losses or about \~600 billion is through the commerical banks. I suspect probably another 300-400 billion though treasuries. So the banking sector has lost about 1 trillion in the past year, of which only maybe 100-200 billion has actually been marked-to-market down as losses.

Remember, the size of the losses in Subprime was only about \~100 billion. Now, every 50 bps increase by the fed results in close to that much in losses to the banking sector. So yes, Mr. Powell wil likely blow up the entire banking system.

Edit 1: Alot of people are pointing out that the deposit base of other banks are signficantly different. Yes 100% agree, but the run on liquidity of a bank can come in two ways. One is on the deposit side (see great depression and SVB), the other way is through the intrabank funding market (alas 2008). I will write a part II in the coming days of the drying up of that source of liqudity.

Edit 2: Also a lot of people keep pointing to hedging and managing duration risk. This is BS as all the banks have this unrealized loss on their balance sheet, go look.Imagine God telling everyone he is going to destroy your house, now go and try to find insurance on your house for less than the cost of building a new house. And to the smart asses mentioning swaps. Go ahead and try to swap your house for a new house for anything less 0. Now think termites slowly destroying your house over the course of a year instead an earthquake, good luck being the person trying to hedge that.

Edit 3: on all the people saying the larger banks are so much smarter and know what they are doing. SVB had the most liquid portfolio of any bank out there. They had about 8% of their desposits in cash and about \~45% in GSE/treasuries which is the most liquid instrument out there and can be sold down in a weeks notice. None of the other/largest banks are even close to that. The larger banks have a much lower deposit base like \~25%-30% of their capital base and maybe 10-20% in equity and 50-60% are based in intrabank financing (hello 2008). The finiky parts of the larger bank's capital structure aren't deposits, most of these are FDIC insured (but still probably only half or so as the business accounts certaintly aren't), it is the intrabank financing part. You know, the stuff that blew up lehman and bear sterns. 

Also people don't seem grasp what a bank is and think they should be 100% in cash or something. You do understand banks make money from spreads. Signaling to investors you are taking depositer cash, and investing them in 3-month t-bills yielding 0.25% is a great way to tell them you don't actually have a business model and is a money losing startup like Wework or some shit.

I‚Äôm gonna try keep this short and sweet for all you highly regarded folk. There‚Äôs a lithium mining/battery recycling stock going by the ticker $ABML, which just recently hit the $500 million market cap ($547 million to be precise) meaning the stock can now be spoken about on WSB. 

I may be a little special and I‚Äôm quite baked rn but I‚Äôm going to try lay out for why I think this stock is a potential 10X stock and why you don‚Äôt want to miss this opportunity. 

Firstly, the stock is currently up 78% over the last 3 months, largely as a result of its mining flats in Tonopah being assessed by a third party to contain upwards of 15 million tonnes of Lithium. That‚Äôs the largest supply of Lithium in the entirety of the USA! A country, which until now has been struggling to source and have any real security of its own affordable battery metals. I believe the Biden administration has been looking into ways to sure up America‚Äôs battery metal supply chains, as importing it is costly and relying on other countries isn‚Äôt for Uncle Sam. $ABML may have just stumbled upon the answer and if they have the stock is about to go parabolic.

You know that shit Daddy Musk and every other car company puts in his car batteries? The shit that currently costs more than gold at $70k per tonne‚Ä¶ This company has basically found itself with lithium deposits that are the same weight as 128k fat Jonah Hills. That‚Äôs pretty fucking fat.
So back of the napkin math 15 million tonnes X $70k = $1.25 trillion. That‚Äôs right $1,250,000,000! 

And the best part? $ABML controls 100% of the mining lode claims in the Tonopah flats and the subsurface minerals without any royalties. 
The company also plans to expand the area to the north and south of the property and explore to greater depths. 
90% of the 15 million tonnes is easily recoverable.
And if that‚Äôs not perfect enough, their factory is only 25 miles away from the Tesla gigafactory! 

Secondly, this is a company I‚Äôve been following for years, and it‚Äôs fair to say management hasn‚Äôt always been the best. The company is currently down 75% from it‚Äôs ATH of $4 per share, attributable to the slow progress they have made up till now. However, this company is now run by their fairly newly appointed CEO Ryan Melsert, an ex-Tesla employee who realised the importance (and financial benefits) of securing America‚Äôs battery metals supply chain. The guy is an absolute genius, the company has won countless awards and government grants for its unique, patented and environmentally-friendly way of recycling battery metals. 

The whole point of switching to electric cars is to reduce carbon emissions and damage to the environment. This company allows for what may be the most environmentally-friendly and scalable battery recycling process in the world. $ABML have a factory 25 miles from Tesla‚Äôs gigafactory and have signed agreements to recycle Ford, Chevrolet and GM‚Äôs battery feedstock. 

The company is currently pre-revenue, however I do believe that will change this year with the opening of their pilot plant. Despite the negative economic outlook we are in at the moment I can really see this stock outperforming the broader market. They‚Äôre flush with cash despite burning through it due to building their new factory. The amount of Lithium within the Tonopah flats alone is worth more than Amazon. 

Who‚Äôs to say Musk doesn‚Äôt buy the company outright? I really don‚Äôt see that as an impossibility given the company‚Äôs purpose, it‚Äôs location and the CEO‚Äôs ties to Tesla. If that happens I‚Äôd probably need to repaint my ceiling cuz my erection would be doing all sorts of damage to it.

11l1ui8,Fed Chair Powell says interest rates are ‚Äòlikely to be higher‚Äô than previously anticipated,"* Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday cautioned that interest rates are likely to head higher than central bank policymakers had expected.
* ‚ÄúIf the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,‚Äù the central bank leader said in prepared remarks for appearances this week on Capitol Hill.
* Powell said the current trend shows that the Fed‚Äôs inflation-fighting job is not over.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday cautioned that interest rates are likely to head higher than central bank policymakers had expected.

Citing earlier data this year showing that inflation has reversed the deceleration it showed in late 2022, the central bank leader warned of tighter monetary policy ahead.

‚ÄúThe latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,‚Äù Powell said in remarks prepared for two appearances this week on Capitol Hill. ‚ÄúIf the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.‚Äù

Those remarks carry two implications: One, that the peak, or terminal, level of the federal funds rate is likely to be higher than the previous indication from the Fed officials, and, two, that the switch last month to a smaller quarter percentage point increase could be short-lived of inflation data continue to run hot.

In their December estimate, officials pegged the terminal rate at 5.1%. Current market pricing is a bit higher than that, in the 5.25%-5.5% areas, according to CME Group data. Powell did not specify how high he thinks rates ultimately will go.

The speech comes with markets generally optimistic that the Fed can tame inflation without running the economy into a ditch.

However, January data show that inflation as gauged by personal consumption expenditures prices ‚Äî the preferred metric for policymakers ‚Äî was still running at a 5.4% pace annually. That‚Äôs well above the Fed‚Äôs 2% long-run target and a shade above the December level.

Powell said the current trend shows that the Fed‚Äôs inflation-fighting job is not over.

‚ÄúWe have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do,‚Äù he said.

The Fed has raised its benchmark fund rate eight times over the past year to its current targeted level between 4.5%-4.75%. On its face, the funds rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending. But it feeds through to a multitude of other consumer debt products such as mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.

In recent says, some officials, such as Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, have indicated that they see the rate hikes coming to a close soon. However, others, including Governor Christopher Waller, have expressed concern about the recent inflation data and say tight policy is likely to stay in place.

‚ÄúRestoring price stability will likely require that we maintain a restrictive stance of monetary policy for some time,‚Äù Powell said. ‚ÄúThe historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done.‚Äù

Powell noted some progress on inflation for areas such as housing.

However, he also noted ‚Äúthere is little sign of disinflation‚Äù when it comes to the important category of services spending excluding housing, food and energy. That is an important qualifier considering that the chairman at his post-meeting news conference in early February said the disinflationary process had begun in the economy, remarks that helped send stocks higher.

Markets mostly expect the Fed to enact a second consecutive quarter point, or 25 basis points, rate increase at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting later this month. However, traders are pricing in close to a 30% probability of a higher half-point increase, according to CME Group data.

Powell reiterated that rate decisions will be made ‚Äúmeeting by meeting‚Äù and will be dependent on data and their impact on inflation and economic activity, rather than a pre-set course.

110mkdo,"Ride the AI Roller Coaster to Strike Gold: Invest in NVIDIA, ASML, and TSMC and step into the future.","Investing in shovels for gold miners is like betting on a unicorn riding a rainbow while juggling pineapples - a surefire win! These shovels, however, aren't just ordinary spades, but rather glittering tools of wonder like NVIDIA's A100 GPUs, ASML's magic lithography wands, and TSMC's almighty hammer of semiconductor creation.  

But wait! The high price-to-earnings ratios and market capitalizations of these companies might seem like clouds in the sky of your financial prosperity. But fear not, for these companies have built walls as strong as a castle made of jellybeans, guarded by dragons made of cotton candy.  For instance, NVIDIA's GPUs are like the steering wheel of a spaceship navigating through the vast galaxies of data centers, autonomous vehicles, and gaming systems. The company's grip on these markets, combined with its constant innovation and R&D, make it a force to be reckoned with, like a superhero made of marshmallows.  

In the same vein, ASML's lithography machines are like the pen of a wizard, casting spells to create advanced semiconductors. The company has a monopoly as strong as a fortress made of gingerbread, in this market. TSMC, on the other hand, has positioned itself as the go-to choice for chip creation, like a genie granting wishes for companies like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD.  

As the world advances towards the future, with AI and technology as its beacon, these companies are like rockets ready to soar, like a kite on a windy day. It's like what the Pied Piper of Hamelin said, ""The journey of AI is long, but it dances towards the future."" And as AI continues to dance in this direction, the demand for NVIDIA's GPUs, ASML's lithography machines, and TSMC's semiconductor manufacturing capabilities will only escalate, like a party that never ends. 

Investing in these companies is like taking a ride on a roller coaster of wealth, with the future as your destination. The gold miners may come and go, but the shovel sellers will always be in demand, like a song that never grows old. So, grab your shovels, put on your dancing shoes, and let's strike gold!

110vapn,AirBnB is going to shit the bed on earnings,"AirBnB occupancy levels had fallen MoM for 8 straight months straight by the end of October, with AirBnB's management expecting holiday revenue for 2022 to be below analysts' expectations. This, combined with local governments cracking down more on short-term rentals + rising consumer dissatisfaction with the procedures involved with staying in AirBnBs, makes me think AirBnB's revenue and EPS may fall short of the Street's expectations for them but, more importantly, I think they'll reduce guidance for Q1 2023. 

On the flip side, US hotel occupancy rates were at their 4th highest levels for Q4 from the last 23 years during Q422, with occupancy at 54.2%, and with 40 markets, including Atlanta, Boston, and Chicago, saw their highest occupancy ever for the last reporting week of the year. This, combined with the fact that hospitality research firms are expecting strong Q1 and Q2 growth for hotel carriers compared to 2022 due to a lack of Omicron on people's minds + already seeing huge explosion in average daily rates and revenue per available room when compared to pre-pandemic levels, makes me think that MAR and H are great plays for 5% swings within 2 weeks of reporting later this week if you get in on Monday.

115jk4j,"The Fed in November 2007 ""U.S. economy did not appear headed for recession"". A month later, December 2007, The Great Recession begins","The no-landing narrative was and is so fucking stupid and I can't believe people are falling for this shit again. The Fed is saying all of the same things they were saying over 15 years ago. The Fed chair at the time, Ben Bernanke, told lawmakers that the [U.S. economy did not appear headed for recession.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bernanke-idUSWBT00789120071108) "" Our assessment is for slower growth, but positive growth, going into next year.""

Powell at the last FOMC press conference ""my base case is slower growth, but that there will be positive growth this year.  My forecast and that of my colleagues as you will see from the SEP, it's a forecast of slower growth, some softening in labor market conditions, and inflation moving down steadily but not quickly.""

Loretta Mester last week: ""I expect growth to slow, but still positive. I do not expect a recession.""

Patrick Harker last week: ""Growth will be slow but I do not expect a recession. I am not forecasting a recession.""

Thomas Barkin last week: ""Growth is slowing, but will remain positive. Data continues to point to no recession.""

Neel Kashkari two weeks ago: ""A recession is not in my forecast. I expect growth to slow but remain positive.""

Raphael Bostic two weeks ago: ""We have a good chance of avoiding a recession.""

John Williams on Jan 19: ""I expect slower growth around of around 1% of this year. I do not forecast a recession.""

Lael Brainard on Jan 19: ""Data points to slower growth in the future. Recent data indicates slightly better chances of avoiding a recession. I do not expect a recession.""

James Bullard on Jan 2: "" I still think we'll have below trend growth. I anticipate slow growth. The likelihood of a soft landing has increased. I do not forecast a recession.""

You get the fucking point. It's goddamn deja vu up in here. How quickly the markets forget..

The Fed's near-term forward spread, the yield spread that the Fed views as a leading indicator, has dramatically inverted. JPow has been quoted many times saying this is the yield curve they're watching, and if it inverts they will have to cut rates because they're in a recession. On March 21, 2022, JPow says ‚ÄúFrankly,¬†there‚Äôs good research by staff in the Federal Reserve system that really says to look at the short -- the first 18 months -- of the yield curve. That‚Äôs really what has 100% of the explanatory power of the yield curve. It make sense. Because if it‚Äôs  inverted, that means the Fed‚Äôs going to cut, which means the economy is weak.‚Äù Here's the paper they wrote about the near-term forward spread [https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018055pap.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018055pap.pdf)

Here's what the near-term forward spread currently looks like

Then it was the work from home stocks because of the lockdowns. Then it was buttcorn and nfts because we ran out of shit to sell. And now it's AI.

The big fraud I'm seeing with AI is that **it's being presented as if a company has some computer is able to ""think.""** That's the gotcha. The software can't think--it just creates responses that make you, the human user, **believe the software is much more capable than it actually is.** 

I'm not a neural network AI Python software engineering person. But I'm also not a fucking idiot, despite what my mom says. I know for a fact these AI systems are just glorified web scrapers that generate results in the form of a human-like messages. Because theses ""AI"" programs cannot ""think"" there's no actual ""intelligence"" to be had. 

If you think you're going to buy MSFT calls because they dumped 10BN into AI then you're a goon. MSFT has done tons of dumb shit: developing Windows 11, making Cortona, **and removing 3D Pinball Space Cadet are just a few really dumb things this company has done.** Not everything they touch turns to gold, a lot of it turns to turds. Hell, just the other day the AI they used in Bing was harassing users who were asking it hard questions. What a shit show.

All jokes aside, I've seen this one so many times. Cathie Wood sells me ARK because the tech rally was imminent and then it crashes. Peter Schiff tries to sell me gold because the financial system collapse is imminent and then we rally. Elon Musk sells me a Tesla that self drives itself into a fucking fire truck. 

It's all fake business. Do not get caught up in the hype. Make calculated bets using Theta strats and don't get caught listening to these goons. Nobody is ever going to tell you how to make money with bets or investing, but I will bet all 3 of my testicles that you will lose money if you bet on AI winning. 

Have a happy Sunday night. 

And VisualMod, I know you're going to comment on this because you're an AI fanboy but I just want you to know I think you're alright--even if you're a robot.",BeardlessPete,509,1676862537.0

""Apartment rents fell in every major metropolitan area in the U.S. over the past six months through January, a trend that is poised to continue as the biggest delivery of new apartments in nearly four decades is slated for this year""

Since housing and rent have made up a large part of the CPI number, the hypothesis would be that declining rents would impact CPI thus decreasing MoM and YoY numbers.

Pivot. Inbound.

1144ms6,50 BPS Hike‚Ä¶ the nail in the bear coffin‚Ä¶ 2-16-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,"note- MODS reposted due to my chart on the VIX having a banned ticker in it... forgot to crop it out this time. i wasnt mentioning banned ticker its just the way tradingview displays the VIX for some reason... 

&#x200B;

So this morning as I said we had PPI and jobs data and there was a chance for quite the negative reaction. Well as you see below that data came in VERY HOT. PPI MoM went from -0.4% to 0.7%+ that is one hell of a rebound! 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6y13euelymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=074aab4603aac6ebb22c8742d06ee325a9a7b1ae

Now add what FOMC said about numerous rate hikes and CPI not being under control, CPI coming in over consensus and showing that the decline is slowing AND factor in PPI now and we finally might see the wind taken out of the bulls sail‚Ä¶ 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/srxx5orlymia1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b47cfba028b2d0d4685bf6893714f526afded492

Something I don‚Äôt talk about much because honestly I am just not well versed enough in it to explain well enough is that bonds and equities have NOT been behaving correctly. We have been seeing this whole rally the 2, and 10yr yields massively rally along with DXY while you guessed it‚Ä¶ SPY rallied too‚Ä¶ those two should not really be doing that at all.. 

Now something that happened yesterday and post CPI is that the peak fed funds rate expectation has steadily rose this weak but the markets did not negatively react to that either. 

We might finally be seeing‚Ä¶ that market reaction. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h5xzmx6mymia1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f8baa7a27a6d38e1a843f4a4d516abece0d69f66

Now here is something very interesting to think about‚Ä¶ We have been under this impression that we are going to continue to see 25bps hike rates until we finally get to the ‚Äúend‚Äù however, today for the first time the idea of 50bps was introduced by two fed members. Now granted JPOW himself has not said he would do a 50bps hike but there is no doubt that he isnt done with rate hikes‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eabedxkmymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5a6f5d020f5548567d41718adf38bf2c1c557bff

Taking a look at the CME expected BPS hike for March meeting it has actually rose to 18.1% from about 12% this morning. What actually is more impressive about this is that last meeting a 50bps wasn‚Äôt even in question. 

So the question now remains‚Ä¶ did the market finally put a nail in the bears coffins? Is this market FINALLY going to accept the fact that inflation is not over, and that we are not going back to ATH and that the market is actually not in a good place? IS this finally the end of this insane bully rally we have been on for almost 2 months now? We will find out tomorrow‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wjcqp88nymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=59b7ae7f496feebbc3ad9b163d0f129fdce9f07d

Now we have seen this time and time again where we break down and test the 20ema then bounce. However, this time really is quite different‚Ä¶ we are actually seeing this as a break through of this bull support (again) and this also at the same time is a rejection of the daily 8ema. 

Now this long wicked candle here is not the most ideal candle for downside continuation but it can be a continuation candle. 

The biggest thing I want to note here is that we did clsoe under that key 408.8 support that most of this consolidation has happened in. With that breakdown it would be natural to assume that we touch 405.3 support tomorrow. 

405.3 still remains critical support. If we see that level broken tomorrow there is a very high probability that this rally is going to see an abrupt end and we could be looking at the 390-400 area by end of next week. 

Key SPY Support- 405.3 -> 402.9 -> 400.8

Key SPY Resistace- 408.8 -> 410.2 -> 414.1

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nypazjonymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=859d2154628f7dc723c12eeacaeab3c350e3f27c

Futures in my opinion is far more bearish then SPY. Something else that is very interesting to me here on futures is the fact that for probably the last 3-4 days if not longer futures has (as evidence by these lower wicks) been very red after hours and has seen major reallys intraday. Now that we finally (maybe) have a true reason to sell and futures already has been in sell mode.. I am very curious to see where futures is going to take us overnight. 

Futures here we also broke the bull channel support with a massive double top off of 4160. With that rejection there and losing the daily 8ema we are in store for a bigger support test. If we happen to lose that support this is going to see an even large sell off. 

What I am watchign for here is this key 4095 support. I will be very curious to see where futures closes here at 5pm. If it drops and closes under 4095 that is even more bearish and really would open the idea for a bigger dump tomorrow. 

The big level here is the daily 20ema at 4093. If we lose that and especially clsoe under that we are likely in store for a continuaton sell off next week. 

Key Futures support- 4095 -> 4085 -> 4040 -> 4030 

Key Futures resistance- 4122 -> 4160

&#x200B;

Tesla caught a really bad news day today and we might perhaps also finally be seeing the end of this rally. 

We have not only a bad news day for Tesla but with SPY selling off AND back to back rejections off the daily 200ema at that critical 215 level I would nto be surprised to see a bigger sell off tomorrow. 

Tesla is now at a test of its daily 8ema and very well could find itself testing the daily 20ema down near 184 tomorrow or early next week. 

One thing to keep in mind here though is that tesla IS still in its bull channel. Realistically until we break that support it is only speculation on whether we are going to see a further sell off on tesla or not‚Ä¶

However, breaking below that going into next week could set up a very nice short opportunity especially If the overall markets are on board too. 

Key Tesla Support- 202 -> 196.8 -> 191.8 -> 183.6

Key Tesla resistance- 211 -> 215 -> 219.2

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xgkubrppymia1.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89008e5b64816fb52f03784415cae3924e477001

The VIX just managed to close a huge 10.65% green day today‚Ä¶ this is the biggest move up on the VIX since December 22nd(9.57%+) and December 12th (9.6%+). 

This is the first 10% green close on the VIX since September 13th which was a 14.33% green day. 

&#x200B;

With the VIX double bottoming perfectly off 18.2 and closing back over 19.7 we could be looking at an even bigger push up into the 21-22 area tomorrow. 

Interestingly enough tomorrow is monthly OPEX and we have a really nice max pain down at that critical 405 support area. Earlier in the day when we were near 414 it seemed like a dream that we would touch 405 tomorrow and I would never take a trade strictly based off max pain but the chances of touching 405 tomorrow has significantly increased. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c41n14yqymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8a8faacdc415e8d8653d5ee12f5fcf6c566657cc

One kind of interesting data point for tomorrow is the fact that the put call ratio is 2.72 for tomorrow‚Ä¶ that is about the highest PC I have seen in weeks on SPY. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a bigger dump tomorrow and we could even end up with a bigger EOD rally too with all that put OI coming off the books‚Ä¶ 

Tomorrow could be one extremely volatile day‚Ä¶

**Daily log-**

https://preview.redd.it/i6acnzhrymia1.png?width=799&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4cdea3fa9e364d408d5249ba684c5257f019c1a5

After a pretty crappy three days of trading this week I was very happy to close out a green day‚Ä¶ sure its not a huge green day and sure its still a red week but going 3 for 4 today was a good day for me. No complaints at all. 

Interestingly enough I took the first two trades before 1030 am and didn‚Äôt take that last one until 1pm. I just as much as I knew it was a buy the dip day there just was zero movement. 

Pretty much from 11am until 1215pm it was untradable and then we were looking for that bigger EOD bounce after Biden briefed us on aliens and well that never came. I have a pretty hard fast rule of Not trading power hour‚Ä¶ have been burnt WAY too many times and was happy to sit it out even though I would have liked to have entered a put. 

I did take a put end of date on futures that I just closed out a 20.3%... will include that in tomorows log as that was technically a swing play and closed after markets closed at 415pm for the day. 

Overall tomorrow is Friday and it should be a wild end to the week. 

To me‚Ä¶ a closure under 408.8 is very bearish for next week and I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a bigger sell off next week. 

If by some chance the bulls can once again buy the dip and put this back over 410 we might see some upside next week or find ourselves once again in another sideways week.",DaddyDersch,308,1676590481.0

[You nerds are going to make WBD execs a lot of money](https://preview.redd.it/zp8ylxk25yja1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cbe307506dcba50fb295860bc919e10871b1b16a)

# Overview

Hogwarts Legacy's physical sales have already outpaced Elden Ring by 80% while digital sales are outpacing by 56% as of this morning ([source 1](https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-stats-successful-launch/), [source 2](https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-sales-numbers-so-far-figures-record/)). Assuming a blended 65% increase over Elden Ring's sales at an assumed $65/unit sold (many special editions have been purchased), **the game has generated a rough estimate of approximately $1.3B in the first two weeks of release**.

There are no known major issues with the game (some bugs present on Steam but no more than typical) and once it is clear the game is a hit among fans and the development is solid, the sales momentum should continue. Additionally, this momentum will likely see some benefit from the release of Hogwarts Legacy on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch at later dates:

Overall, Hogwarts Legacy will probably generate at least $2B in revenue for WBD within the first year of its release. The massive success of this game will open the door for more opportunities to expand on the Harry Potter franchise potentially including DLC for the game and possibly, a [new movie](https://screenrant.com/harry-potter-cursed-child-movie-release-date-cast-story-will-it-happen/).

# FY23 Estimates

[source: https:\/\/app.tikr.com\/ \(you need to sign up but it's free\)](https://preview.redd.it/mqza0wsp5yja1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b1262b607d7c9d355b5d9089f63d799d902af061)

**WBD is currently trading at a discounted 0.75x P/BV** with a forward FCF Yield of 5.7%. Estimated sales for WBD is $44.2B for 2023 (2% growth YoY, median of analyst estimates from Bloomberg, sourced from [https://app.tikr.com/](https://app.tikr.com/)) which surely includes Hogwarts Legacy sales but this estimate is probably a bit conservative based on very strong sales figures so far.

If WBD guides for an extra $500MM to $1B in sales for the year based on initial sales, this would imply a 3-4% increase in total sales (vs 2% estimate) which for a stagnant company like WBD, is a fairly big deal. Profit margins for new big name VGs can approach 50% or higher so with at least $2B in sales, at least a $1B increase in FCF seems realistic and would bring WBD's FCF Yield up to a favorable 7%.

# TL;DR - Focus on FY23 guidance, not past results!

* Hogwarts Legacy will generate at least $2B in sales in its first year
* WBD will likely increase revenue and earnings guidance for the year based on Hogwarts Legacy's strong sales so far
* Mgmt will want to further leverage the Harry Potter franchise given the massive success of the videogame with potential for DLC, another movie, or even a tv series (a la Disney)
* Markets are not yet pricing in the sizable revenue and FCF increase Hogwarts Legacy will contribute with WBD trading at a discounted 0.75x P/BV

My Position:

WBD has earnings AH today and I'm in the 17C expiring tomorrow, June, selling 14P exp March, and am holding shares. In case you don't know what to do, here's a chart giving you terrible instructions:

|*Investor Type*|*Trade*|
|:-|:-|
|Boomer|Buy shares or 20C LEAPs, wait at least a few quarters for increased sales to be baked into stock price|
|Thetagang|Sell OTM or ATM Mar puts based on risk tolerance, get assigned at a lower price or make 50-80% annualized return|

* WBD will likely increase revenue and earnings guidance for the year based on Hogwarts Legacy's strong sales so far
* Mgmt will want to further leverage the Harry Potter franchise given the massive success of the videogame with potential for DLC, another movie, or even a tv series (a la Disney)
* Markets are not yet pricing in the sizable revenue and FCF increase Hogwarts Legacy will contribute with WBD trading at a discounted 0.75x P/BV

My Position:

11ola2t,Stock traders eagerly awaiting Jim Cramer‚Äôs recommendations so they can do the exact opposite,"NEW YORK‚ÄîStock traders across the country are eagerly awaiting the latest recommendations from CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer, only to immediately do the exact opposite.

According to sources within the financial industry, traders have grown tired of Cramer‚Äôs hyperbolic predictions and erratic stock picks, and have instead turned to his advice as a surefire way to lose money.

‚ÄúI used to follow Jim‚Äôs picks religiously, but then I realized that whatever he recommended was usually a terrible idea,‚Äù said one anonymous trader. ‚ÄúNow, I just wait for him to announce his latest recommendation, and then I immediately short that stock. It‚Äôs like clockwork.‚Äù

Cramer, for his part, seems unfazed by the phenomenon. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôve made some bad calls in the past, sure,‚Äù he said in a recent interview. ‚ÄúBut my track record speaks for itself. I‚Äôm still one of the most respected voices in the industry.‚Äù

Despite Cramer‚Äôs confidence, however, the trend seems to be catching on. Traders across Wall Street are reportedly sharing tips on social media about how to profit from doing the opposite of Cramer‚Äôs picks, and some have even started to develop automated trading algorithms that scan his recommendations in real time.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of like a game now,‚Äù said another anonymous trader. ‚ÄúWe all know that whatever Cramer says, we should do the opposite. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs our own personal contrarian indicator.‚Äù

For now, it seems that the ‚ÄúCramer effect‚Äù is here to stay. While some analysts have suggested that traders will eventually tire of the trend and return to more traditional investment strategies, others believe that Cramer‚Äôs influence may have irreparably damaged his reputation in the eyes of the trading community.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if Jim will ever be able to shake this,‚Äù said one industry insider. ‚ÄúThe fact that traders are actively seeking out his recommendations just so they can do the opposite is a pretty damning indictment of his credibility.‚Äù

118k9fs,How to Read (and understand) the 4 Financial Statements:," Not that anyone in WSB cares but there are four financial statements that every investor should know:

* Balance Sheet
* Income Statement
* Cash Flow Statement
* Stockholders‚Äô Equity Statement

**Income Statement:**

The income statement, also known as the profit and loss statement, provides information about a company‚Äôs profitability and ability to generate income. It shows a company‚Äôs revenues, expenses, and net income over a specific period, making it an essential tool for investors to understand a company‚Äôs financial performance.

https://preview.redd.it/ytvso0o4zmja1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2d1cb6f5290da7d315f498535a8569d4600f6569

 The income statement is divided into two main sections: the income section and the expense section. The income section lists all the revenues that the company earned during the period, such as sales, interest income, and gains on investments. The expense section lists all the expenses that the company has incurred during the period. This includes the cost of goods sold, selling and administrative expenses, and interest expenses.

The net income (or loss) for the period is determined by subtracting expenses from revenues. This amount is then reported at the bottom of the income statement, along with any applicable taxes and the net income (or loss) per share of common stock.

When analyzing an income statement, there are three key items to look for:

1. Revenue growth: This shows whether a company‚Äôs revenue is increasing or decreasing over time, which can be a good indication of the company‚Äôs overall health and growth prospects
2. Profit margins: This refers to how much of the company‚Äôs revenue is being turned into profits. Higher profit margins are generally a positive sign, as they indicate that the company is managing its expenses
3. Expense management: This indicates whether a company is controlling its expenses. If a company‚Äôs expenses are rising faster than its revenues, it can be a red flag

**Balance Sheet:**

The balance sheet, also known as the statement of financial position, provides information about a company‚Äôs financial position, including its liquidity and solvency. It provides a snapshot of a company‚Äôs financial position at a specific point in time. It shows the company‚Äôs assets, liabilities, and equity, which helps investors understand the company‚Äôs net worth.

https://preview.redd.it/cettgtf8zmja1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cc536a10fc57851bb17fffc0fbf196217fef6786

(1) Assets are resources that the company owns or controls and can include things like cash, accounts receivable, and property, plant, and equipment

(2) Liabilities are the debts and obligations that the company owes to others and can include things like accounts payable, taxes payable, and long-term debt

(3) Equity represents the ownership interests of the company‚Äôs shareholders. By subtracting the company‚Äôs liabilities from its assets, you can arrive at the company‚Äôs equity, which represents the value of the company‚Äôs ownership interests

When analyzing a balance sheet, there are three key items to look for:

1. Asset quality: This refers to whether the company‚Äôs asset base is strong and diverse. High-quality assets can help a company weather economic downturns and provide a solid foundation for growth
2. Debt levels: This shows whether the company is carrying a lot of debt. High levels of debt can increase a company‚Äôs financial risk and make it more vulnerable to economic downturns
3. Working capital: This reveals whether the company has enough resources to cover its short-term obligations. A company with strong working capital is generally considered to be more financially stable

**Cash Flows:**

The statement of cash flows shows how a company generates and uses cash. This helps to understand a company‚Äôs financial health and ability to meet its obligations. It presents the inflows and outflows of cash for a specific period of time and can be used to assess the company‚Äôs liquidity and solvency.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zecqkcebzmja1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=27cf6befc80ba10e3c74665fa7765b3277cff817

 The statement of cash flows is divided into three sections:

1. Operating activities: This includes cash flows from a company‚Äôs core business operations, such as cash received from customers, cash paid to suppliers and employees, and other operating expenses
2. Investing activities: This includes the cash flows from the purchase and sale of long-term assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, as well as investments in other companies, such as through the purchase of stocks or bonds
3. Financing activities: This includes the cash flows from the issuance and repayment of a company‚Äôs debt and equity, such as the issuance of new shares of stock, the repayment of loans, and the payment of dividends to shareholders

To analyze a cash flow statement, look at the company‚Äôs operating cash flow, which represents the cash the company generates from its day-to-day operations. This provides a sense of the company‚Äôs underlying financial strength and ability to generate cash. An essential metric to evaluate is free cash flow, which is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow. Free cash flow represents the amount of cash a company has left over after investing in its business. This cash can be used to pay dividends, repay debt, or invest in new opportunities.

Pay close attention to the net change in cash and cash equivalents on a company‚Äôs statement of cash flows. This figure reflects the increase or decrease in the company‚Äôs cash and cash equivalents during the period. It can provide valuable insights into the company‚Äôs financial health and ability to meet its financial obligations and invest in future growth.

**Stockholders‚Äô Equity:**

The statement of stockholders‚Äô equity provides valuable insights into a company‚Äôs financial health and its ability to generate profits and distribute them to shareholders. It is important because it represents the portion of the company that belongs to shareholders. The statement is divided into two sections:

* The beginning balance shows total equity at the beginning of the period
* The changes during the period include all transactions that have occurred since the beginning of the period

https://preview.redd.it/lvbuor7dzmja1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b8e907c06179a3074e7833b19d008717566f7acb

 The statement of stockholders‚Äô equity includes the following items:

* Common stock: This is the amount of capital that has been contributed by the company‚Äôs shareholders in exchange for common stock
* Additional paid-in capital: The amount of capital that has been contributed by shareholders in excess of the par value of common stock
* Retained earnings: The amount of earnings the company has retained since its inception, after deducting dividends paid to shareholders
* Net income (or loss): This is the company‚Äôs net income (or loss) for the period, which is determined by subtracting the company‚Äôs expenses from its revenues
* Dividends: This is the amount of cash that the company has paid to its shareholders as dividends

To analyze stockholders‚Äô equity, compare the company‚Äôs equity to its assets to get a sense of the company‚Äôs financial leverage. High levels of debt can increase a company‚Äôs financial risk and make it more vulnerable to economic downturns. When analyzing stockholders‚Äô equity, it is important to look for two key things:

* Equity growth: Is the company‚Äôs equity increasing or decreasing over time? This can be a good sign of the company‚Äôs financial health and growth prospects
* Financial leverage: Is the company heavily reliant on debt financing? If so, this can increase the company‚Äôs financial risk and make it more vulnerable to economic downturns.",TonyLiberty,295,1677026647.0

As for me,  likely by Monday morning I'll be looking to short on an equal weight basis (since smaller companies are more likely to be impacted) - though I'm going to review financials this weekend. If a company has no cash on hand, they have less to lose, for example.   Currently I don't have any positions, I spent too long writing this up and the market closed.

These stocks and put options are the most directionaly bearish. Directional bias ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish). It accounts for RSI, trend, moving averages and put/call skew over the past 4 weeks. Fade the recent bearish action by selling high premium puts or get long with puts with low put premiums.

Cheap Puts

These put options offer the lowest ratio of bearish premium paid (IV) relative to historical volatility (HV). These options are priced expecting the underlying to move down significantly less than it has moved down in the past. Buy these puts.

110plza,Red Week Incoming!,"#  SPY Analysis

 A lot of constructive action going on here in the higher time frames of the SPY. On the weekly chart, we can see several things which started to change the tide. We‚Äôve begun to make higher lows on the weekly chart and have set our first higher high in a long time. The week of the 12/19 candle set a new swing pivot low and the week of 1/30 took out that 410 level which we‚Äôve had trouble pushing through since April 2022.

We‚Äôve also got a bit of confluence going with a break of the 200EMA on the daily chart and the weekly downtrend. That‚Äôs three checks in our favor from a technical standpoint that look good if we can continue to hold these levels.¬†

The main thing I‚Äôd like to see here from a bit more of a macro view is any future swing low set above 380. I do think it‚Äôs possible we pull back below this 410 level as well as 200EMA etc. Any swing low set over 380 however keeps the bull thesis intact and keeps us moving in the right direction.

However, if that scenario were to play out then our next move to support the bull thesis in a strong manner would be a a higher higher over 418 and a firm hold of this 410 level.¬†

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kwnjzc7jitha1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8bafd60e51063db0b8b3c07649622be830c97562

 

We can see here on a smaller time frame how key this 410 level has been the past year. It was first held back in March 22‚Äô with authority and then saw a rally to 462 which is our current 52 week high. From there it has been macro lower highs and lower lows. Every time we have traded back to 410 we‚Äôve been met with supply. It‚Äôs not a perfect line in the sane but you can visually see where it was attempted to hold above and failed 5 times prior.¬†

Now that we are back over 410 I think there‚Äôs a good chance that we see a move back to the downside and this isn‚Äôt the magical trend line break everyone must be thinking that ignites a new bull market.¬†

Any pullback here into the low 390s and at the very most > 380 would be deemed constructive. I‚Äôd like to see some sort of move held around 390 - 395 and base there a bit before we make another move back to 410 with our most recent lower high in place to retest at 418.¬†

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8zf0f5lmitha1.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ac03fc93206b6e311668b89d42f80e0572a6b973

 

The shorter term trend within the last 3 months is without a doubt up. The trend line on the 4HR chart below is set from the market rally starting in October 2022. From here we see consistent higher highs and higher lows with our only failure being in mid December at the 410 level.

We‚Äôve held higher and grinded back to that level now, not setting a lower high at 410 but assuring we got the liquidity that was set above that 414 high in December.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/huwco15pitha1.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7c2ad63b9c57ffd521aa53813227ab2b758eef9b

 

Viewing the action more closely since we‚Äôve tapped that liquidity at 414 we‚Äôve been visually weaker. On Feb 2nd when pushing to 418 I started getting some texts about the ‚Äúbull market being back‚Äù so taking that as a hint on where the crowd is learning.

Notice the volume surge on our push into the liquidity area as well. Since then we‚Äôve begun setting lower highs and lower lows. With a clear fail under 410 towards the end of this past week.

This has me leaning towards a further pullback sooner rather than later. I think the next move will be down and we will roll over this demand around 403-404 that was formed for the push to 410+. With that being said, if we do roll over and fail that demand zone then 395-400 will more than likely come quickly within a week of failing that zone.

It is possible that we base here for a few days and make a shot at a move higher. If that‚Äôs the case, watch closely how price reacts in the 410-415 area. If toppy and is clearly selling this would be a great area to get a short position.¬†

The real move here that can create a substantial move to the upside is a significant push through 420 on volume squeezing shorts out. The only thing is the probabilities of this given the multi-month rally, February seasonality, and topping signs in the main liquidity zone seem rather low.

&#x200B;

### Strongest Sector

The Energy sector remains visually the strongest sector at the moment. Really the only sector in a clear up trend and within striking distance of its ATH. We‚Äôre now flagging out here on the weekly chart here and getting tighter. If we see a further market rally this year then this is primed to set new ATHs.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iikasluuitha1.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fbef2d4e1a8921a783b97e1f9d22b23d4fcc1b60

Furthering this, the financial sector in my opinion looks the most poised for money to flow into if there were to be a new favored sector. Reclaiming its neckline and setting consecutive higher lows. As long as 35.50 holds then could see some inflows. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qxz72yoxitha1.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=80522484fb729094cf6d43597c19dd948ad80377

 Looking away from the charts we can see that the Tech, Utilities, and Health Care sectors have reported the least amount of earnings misses so far. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kfhv1380jtha1.png?width=435&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e36c76ec0508541ac59a4e324d52ed9559660f9d

 

### Macro News and Themes

The current overall momentum theme sector-wise has been AI talk. We‚Äôve seen the ticker $AI running and creating momentum in the small cap space forming sympathy plays.

The theme seems to have originated from the overall hype of the ChatGPT launch or relaunch, seeing within a week of numerous shit co‚Äôs tagging ChatGPT in their headlines.

&#x200B;

Furthering this in the overall markets, we‚Äôre in the middle of the Earnings Season. It seems that profits are starting to shrink amid inflation and a rough future outlook on market direction.

At a quick glance, it seems that there a lot of strong earnings gaps but the following days result in profit taking. This could be profit taking as the multi-month rally becomes toppy.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ykyod417jtha1.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dbedab2e408a1eddbcd88647413780b18638ac48

 Also worth noting is the seasonality this time of the year tends to bring which is a bearish tilt. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a4i0dhb9jtha1.png?width=833&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1038dcffb33ce92a08676a6322f958cc9f249489

Lastly, upcoming Economic Data. The calendar this week is pretty busy. The main watch for me is the CPI report. I feel that this will act as a catalyst for our next directional move. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i41vwyibjtha1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c9f01567baccfef92e309a0b4e86159c1fc4181f

### Big Trades Setting Up

The biggest trade going into the week is the CPI numbers and the directional trade that‚Äôs likely to come into the markets afterward. A lot of variables stacking up at the moment that is tilting towards the next move being down so will be interesting to see if CPI is the catalyst to get that done.¬†

With a busy earnings week coming up, any stocks releasing great reports + guidance are always a notable watch.

As far as momentum names setting up BBAI, AI, and SOUN are still within trend. We already had profit taking days there and temporary tops are in place but wouldn‚Äôt be the craziest thing in the world to see another leg higher. I feel if that were the case then it‚Äôd be a true hype sector move where we see multiple legs.¬†

Not really seeing many Large Caps either at the moment. Seems that all the stocks which were on significant runs are now on the backside of their move. Names being CVNA, COIN, NVDA & TSLA.

1) GDP growth was a 3.2% in Q4 2022 led by exports ( government's data) but on the other hand the dollar appreciated by more than 7% in Q4 so the increasing currency rate made it delusional that the exports grew, what actually happened was that exports didn't grow instead the currency grew which made the value of exports rise, and because the imports got relatively cheaper the value diminished. 
 
2) The Inventory to sales ratio reached 1.37 by December which is a clear sign that sales are not upto the mark. 
 
3) The lay-offs were high still the unemployment rate didn't increase because of the high employment rate in mining and government services, otherwise if we look at the construction sector the rate is 6.9%, and according to economic models a recession starts when the construction sector's profits decrease as people are not investing and expansion is not feasible in near future.

Ps: I myself believe that there will be a deep recession if interest rates keep increasing.

Edit: I also wanted to add that US should introduce a subject of manipulation instead of economics because that's what leads to success, economics is realy for us geeks.",OwnInformation229,187,1677394525.0

113c2bg,Losing Your Wellbeing Is Worse Than Losing Money,"\*\*Mods please do not remove this post. It's a reminder of mental health.\*\*

The S&P 500 is in a holding pattern. This ends in two ways; let's not paint this picture as anything but a black and white scenario. The market will either break up or down from this point. It will climb to heaven or crater into the abyss of Hell. Tears will fall and dicks will rise. Regardless of whatever you purchased or shorted to prepare for a moment like this, your mental health will be affected in some way. Since I don't give a fuck about winners, I want to speak to those who will inevitably experience a loss whichever way this market goes in the next couple of minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months. I don't know. If you thought I was going to predict where this rigged economy of green and red candles was headed next, you can stop reading and continue taking your investment advice from Bernie Madoff's ghost. 

I've seen people personally who have struggled with depression. We share a community of people that point out the flaws of our stupid decisions because some are actually stupid. There is a reason why ""Inverse WSB"" can ~~sometimes~~ mostly be profitable . We laugh. We deride. However, we always want you to stay long in life and never cut a runner short. When the market breaks from this range between 4180 and 4081 on SPX, some people will make a lot of money and some will get slaughtered. I mean, hung upside, skinned, and beheaded type slaughtered. It will get ugly. Your portfolio will remind you of The Shining when the elevator door opened. However, I, this community, your family and friends, or your beautiful dogs and cats would be empty with you, your presence, and your energy. 

At the end of the day, it ***really*** is only money. It's relatively meaningless, outside of what you need to eat and drink. I've seen homeless people rocking Ray Bands, a MacBook Pro, and a cute tent, living on Venice Beach and looking out towards the grand Pacific (not too bad honestly). They're broke functionally, technically, rhetorically, and metaphorically. I mean, poorer than you (or most of you). Though, some of them have a good outlook on life. Others want to give you drugs, and some want to swing a machete in your back. But, by in large, they're oddly positive about their current situation. The moral of this story is that if they can be, you can be. Wherever this market may break, please do not let your loss break you. I care and many in this wonderful community care about your mental health.",upsidevalue,173,1676504285.0

11omrpm,"You don't ""call"" the bottom of a decade long bubble","You're not a disconnected, hyperrational being that is some sort of purely neutral observer of markets, you're an 85 IQ internet addicted permavirgin that has lost your ability to focus more than 30 seconds without getting angry.

Your ""instincts"" for trading were forged and trained in a total economic anomaly, you know absolutely nothing about trading, about markets, about investing, about anything really. You think ""buying the dip"" is some sort of revolutionary strategy that you've discovered, it's like a lab rat that always manages to find the cheese at the end of the maze being let loose in the wild, the rat would find its way into a cave and run until it starved to death. There's no cheese at the end of the maze, there's no pump after you buy the dip, all there is waiting for you is endless suffering.

Your newfound interest in investing was not something that came to you as an intellectual interest, it began occupying your brain space for the same reason you get an urge to eat Oreo cookies or those Cheetos you've got stuffed under your bed frame, you're an idiot driven purely by emotion that got sucked into the greatest asset bubble the world has ever seen. Asset bubbles are driven by the induced psychology of all its participants, you think you're in charge of your emotions because you've never known what it's like to have an independent thought in your entire life. You can't ""call"" the bottom, you won't ""call"" the bottom, the bottom is when the asset bubble has deflated to a point that you've taken your own life.

11beo3b,Housing Price Go Up Long Term (30+ years) - This Time is NOT Different.,"People keep talking about the impeding housing price crash.

I have no idea if that will happen in the short term but taking a look at a 120-year chart shows homes prices have ended higher in any 30 year period even if someone bought at the peak of 1929.

Yes, yes, I know, ""This time is different.""  I have heard this over and over again except things have yet to be different.

Edit:  

Home prices from 1970 to 1980 went up 250% and never went back down anywhere near initial prices.  1970 to 1980 experienced similar high inflation as compared to now.

https://preview.redd.it/w63ku18zicka1.png?width=1262&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=20b647524719eb571acbc324b38f47f5d3887535

Yes, real asset prices such as homes increase in price during periods of inflation.  On a related note, when inflation stops, real asset prices do not fall back down to their original cost (things stay expensive absent deflation).  

Yes, it is unwise to overextend yourself on a mortgage (e.g., high mortgage payment versus income, not having reserves in case of emergencies or the unexpected).

Yes, psychologically people tend to sell low and buy high (e.g., if a person's home value falls below his or her purchasing price then that person may let the property go). ",safaria2,169,1677308645.0

What we predicted :

&#x200B;

* Eur-Usd down , Gbp-Usd down, Usd-Jpy up, Usd-Cny up. ( Dollar strengthens all other currency weakens )
* Dxy up leads to sell Us-t bonds and rise in Yields.
* Hence the stock market goes down and the dollar becomes the only safe haven.
* Or you can chase the yields in bonds ( or park cash in mmf ) but not the price appreciation in the long end of the bonds because it won't happen for now. Remember yields are inversely proportional to price and long end moves more in price as compared to the front end in the bonds.

Read it you ""Deflationary Economists"" I can see you lurking. xD

&#x200B;

What actually happened :

&#x200B;

* Everything played out nicely. Forex happened exactly as we predicted.
* Dxy went up. Bonds sold off. Yields rose whereas TLT, TMF which chases price appreciation in the long end fell.
* Even my housing DRV etf did well but one thing stayed strong. The USA stock market. It didn‚Äôt even flinch.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Intro :**

So therefore I am writing this letter to explain what‚Äôs going on in the stock market and why is there such a disconnect.

Respected Traders and Investors,

&#x200B;

Before we begin, I would like to apologize to each and every single one of you. I think in these past posts and especially in the comments I have lost a bit of calm. I get angry whenever I see people making profits in this rally or wanting to join this Euphoria in the markets. Man, sometimes I believe I must be a hell of a bad person wanting to crash this market. But then I recall two words in my mind. ‚ÄúSPX $3200‚Äù and then up only xD.

&#x200B;

So moving on, how are you doing friends? I know i suck. Nothing really happened during the V-week or maybe some forces didn‚Äôt let it happen. Now I can entertain you with my wild theories why it did not happen because of ‚ÄúChat GPT'' Feb 14 crash predictions or because of the ‚ÄúCarl Icahn'' and his short positions. I like these stories but i think we cannot rush into such conclusions.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Experiment :**

But what we can do is run the math again and check if we missed something in the calculations.

https://preview.redd.it/0ftr05s50dja1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=53b20ab8c621d19db2081129a2ed495448b6fda5

So if you read my last letter you‚Äôd know that we basically calculated all US 10yr possible yield and added 200 bps of Equity Risk Premia i.e. Erp. I think this is where I made a mistake. I never imagined Erp falling even below 190 bps. I was under the assumption it would be range bound b/w 190-225bps. So therefore we need to check with our quant guy and run the math if the stock market is really undervalued or is it overvalued.

&#x200B;

Quant guy :

* S&P Yields >= 10yr bond yields ( Fed rate exp of 10yr +- Term premia ) + Equity Risk Premia.
* But now let‚Äôs change yields to PE and the formula becomes :
* S&P PE ratio must trade <= 1/ S&P yields from above formula  ( It‚Äôs an old math that inequality reverses )

&#x200B;

Equity risk premia : It is basically a number in basis points what you as an investor demand from the market for a slightly higher yields than bonds.

Term premia : In future i will do a ACM model calculations if you folks are interested in. Just say the word ACM and i will know. Right now all you need to know is basically when Fed hikes rates in front end it expects the long term bond yields to rise but it doesn't. It generally falls because the markets expects Fed to make a mistake and hence the 10-2yr spread becomes -ve i.e. Inversion. But this time around some geniuses in the economics fields are saying that the 10yr is being used for collateral in banking operations. Hence term premia is becoming too negative and causing longer end duration yields to fall more and hence more inversion in the history. Now i do not know the right ans. It's up to you folks to figure out.

&#x200B;

Note : I will be taking historical low Erp for calculations i.e. 1.5% = 150bps.

&#x200B;

[These are the new calculations](https://preview.redd.it/octlwqcc0dja1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6dfb5466d28fe69ae82ba84657b96f20f1377468)

&#x200B;

So we all expect more returns from stock index coz otherwise why shouldn‚Äôt we just buy bonds and therefore the new PE ratios in the above calculations came by adding S&P yields + Erp.

&#x200B;

Now let's do a rough estimate. Current 3.7% 10 yr bond yields and add 150 bps of the equity risk premia. The max PE ratio that S&P 500 can achieve is 19.23. Meaning if we take 225 as earnings estimate ( the street consensus ) max price S&P 500 can achieve is : 19.23 X 225 = $4326.75. This resistance can fail and break if obviously a 10 yr bond yields plummets even below 3.5%. The catalyst for that would be a very good CPI report showing inflation is slowing down. A bad jobs report can do it as well but i think CPI would be the definitive proof to break 3.5%.

&#x200B;

Many of you guys might be like ‚ÄúMan i am not shorting coz there is a huge upside potential‚Äù To them i would say yah i completely agree there is a risk but you need to remember i am taking a historical lowest of all lows Equitiy risk premia plus if bond yields go over 4% equities are done. Right now there seems to be a disconnect in equities. Even at current prices it is still overvalued.

&#x200B;

[The disconnect](https://preview.redd.it/u2pvow1q3dja1.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=03de7f1416a7a93dbc81a00b7428f9ba220d111f)

&#x200B;

Look at this shocking divergence. Bonds and metals all reacted to higher dollar in forex or you can also say higher bond yields. Reason being hot inflation Jan report combined with Jobs and PPI which generally leads CPI report. So i have no doubt in my mind that in upcoming months there is a risk to equities. There are only two reasons that come to my mind why stock market ain't reacting.

&#x200B;

* January due to seasonality makes these numbers look scary. So maybe market wanna confirm the sticky inflation theory with Feb jobs and CPI.
* What if bonds are more risky than stocks and hence causing Equity risk premia to drop like a stone. What if ‚ÄúRisk free is not risk free at all‚Äù Now i know many people don‚Äôt like this take and i completely agree with your 'Firesale of assets"" point. Even i don‚Äôt like this idea but just think about it what other explanation there is for Erp to drop this low. Even a front end is yielding such good returns. You can buy a 6-m t bill and get 5% returns risk free.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Conclusion :**

Stocks should sell off. Remember a key detail on new calculations. There are basically two models of PE and EPS. One is Wsj model where EPS is 222 and PE ratio at 18.35. The other one is multpl model which has PE ratio of 21.80 and EPS 187.07. So in all i think Wsj EPS is totally overvalued coz i saw many Earnings est come down recently according to that model. It should get repriced around March-April. As for multpl website model well it's PE ratio is too high. It's already trading around August peak of 22.02 when rates were suppose to top out at 3.4%.

In all what i am trying to say. Erp has to go up and cause sell off. This mispricing cannot last longer. PE 16 due to rise in bond yields will meet EPS 210-200 due to earnings estimate downgrade this 1st half 2023. It's just my opinion.

&#x200B;

**Bonus  Content :**

Now i am sure many people get bored by my repetitive Q1 disaster posts. Hence it's time to freshen things up. So we all know that :

&#x200B;

USA

Jobs : March 10th

CPI : March 14th

Fomc : March 21-22

important event are going to be released before Fomc. Hence they are going to play a pivotal role for 50bps or 25bps hike. If report again beats expectation meaning CPI higher than expected or jobs markets still resilient it would mean Fed can do a 50bps pushing terminal yields even higher. So bonds will sell off again more aggressively. Stocks this around shall sell off as well.

&#x200B;

This is what media likes to tell you and even the rest of the world on Yt or Twitter. I personally am a wierdo so i say i don't really care but if it causes stocks sell off then good. Right now i am more interested in somewhere else.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Link to the paper : [Ueda San Paper](https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2005/data/wp05e06.pdf)

Yup you're thinking exactly right. I am going to talk about Japan. For those who don't know that on March 9-10 Mr Kuroda is going to do his final Boj meeting. After that he will hand the torch to Ueda san. This guy is neither a dove or a hawk but recently market is pricing him more as a dove but i can assure you he is neither. Go read his paper if you're interested about him. So what's so fascinating about Japan is many of you are thinking.

&#x200B;

So here i present you some interesting visuals about Japan by Black Rock. Basically i write papers for Black Rock and then they publish. Haha i am just kidding. I am just too tired to write guys. I need to post this by Monday night USA.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR :

Japanese policy makers are about to start their rate hike operations this year at least this is what the theory says when inflation is raging in the new regime. Old regime says ""Dont hike"" But remember a key detail which i think only the legendary investors on this planet knows. Mr Ueda san was the only guy in 2000 who didn't vote for a hike in policy. Yes he was a voting member of committee and yah the inflation wasn't that high. Boj still went forward w/o his wishes and did raise rates and then it was only later everyone figured out what a huge mistake that was. I think Japan went into recession because of that.

Link : [Hike rate article](https://money.cnn.com/2000/08/11/asia/boj/)

&#x200B;

Let's see what happens this time around. So what i was trying to say is Mr Kuroda is the one we should be watchful for. He loves surprising markets. So maybe he could shock everyone and raise rates. I still don't believe he has the balls to remove YCC completely but he could easily just widen the band to about 50bps from originally 25bps that he did last to last meeting. All of this is bullish for Yen meaning Dxy goes down. Every legendary investors will short the Japanese bonds causing yields to surge and so theoretically speaking stock market of Japan should go down.

&#x200B;

Trade : Buy $EWV which is basically a 2x leveraged Etf to short Japanese equities. Now it's not easy to short bonds for retail investors hence you can try your luck here.

&#x200B;

[EWV : Keep adding in Golden Zone $16 and base layer of $11.30](https://preview.redd.it/14r79j86ldja1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=495e2ba97aa2061d2038969e879100140bdaf724)

&#x200B;

Note : YCC removal is what causes global implications. Term premia of global bond yields will expand causing global bond yields to rise more. Japanese investors are the largest holder of Us-t bonds. So theoretically speaking they could sell them as well causing more sell off. Hence USA stock market valuations will readjust causing extra bit of sell off. It kinda happened to a small magnitude in Australia 2021. Go check for yourself. But remember it turned out to be a ""Buy the rumor sell the news event"".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts :**

Well to be honest guys i am sad. It is my birthday and here i am writing this stupid letter just because market did not sold off. I even forgot to watch ""You"" Season 4. Liverpool finally on winning tracks is helping me stay positive but i think i am gonna be sad if they loses to Real Madrid in home leg. I haven't even watched anime in a long time. I had planned at least four this month. But seriously what will make me more sad is if ""Pedro Pascal"" does not win an Emmy this yr. Man has been killing it in The Last of us and there is still a ""Mandolorian"" waiting to come out. Do you guys know Ashley and Troy are about to do a cameo in Last of Us. And hey btw any of you playing ""Hogwarts Legacy"" ? Man WB shares has been killing it. God hope my $PARA shares pays out nicely. Even Warren Buffet bought the dip just to play MI7 theme. Yahhhhhhoooo. Sucks! I am not paying $META anything but yah i will buy $GOOGL if it collapse -50% just like META did after Sandberg left. In all what i am trying to say

&#x200B;

""If people don't like buying Chinese shares and even the government are trying to ditch China so why on earth should markets go up just because of PBOC liquidity injections narrative causing global liquidity to rise. I do not buy China ""E"" X USA ""PE"" ratio narrative even though crypto are booming because of this narrative""

1160cf1,"KitKat maker Nestle has said it will raise its prices again this year, despite an 8.2% increase in 2022."," 

The world's biggest food company said it would be forced to charge more to cover the increasing cost of ingredients.

Nestle, which also makes Buitoni pasta, Buxton mineral water and Nescafe coffee, said it was taking a ""massive"" hit to its margins at the moment.

It refused to say how much prices would climb this year.

Boss Mark Schneider said the company suffered in 2022 because of the ""many challenges and tough choices for families, communities and businesses"" which led to lower spending on many of the firm's products.

Nestle's net profits for the year were 9.27bn Swiss francs (¬£8.34bn), which was much lower than the 11.58 billion francs (¬£10.42bn) expected by analysts.

As a result the company will spend 2023 ""with a focus on restoring our gross margin"", said Mr Schneider.",MobileAmphibian6399,157,1676777214.0

11mh5jc,Oi! Listen here ya little shits.,"Last week I worked with Reddit to send out a feedback survey, to get a sense of how much you're all liking WSB

Those who selected any option other than ""not at all"" will be spared.

Now that the results are back, let's dig in!

* 6010 messages were sent

* 119 were filled

* 2% response rate

So right off the bat, you lot are a bunch of lazy cunts. Unsurprising.

Are you at least satisfied cunts?

* 59% were satisfied with WallStreetBets

* 67% of all users in similar sized subreddits were satisfied

You telling me you enjoy r/EarthPorn more than WSB? There isn't even any porn there. I'll show you similarly sized...

Really though, what's the deal? I should have sent these surveys out to your wives.

* Did you all lose your lunch money?

* Was it because we haven't put rainbow dicks in the banner in a few months? 

* Is it because we haven't run a paper trading competition in a while?

Also, get this...

* 15% reported that they see harmful content on the sub multiple times a week.

The heck? It's not like *all* the posts here are shilling scams like PLTR and TSLA. 

There are some actually profitable companies posted here sometimes, like ~~GME~~, ~~BBBY~~, ~~AMC~~, uh... CVNA? is that profitable?

At least we did okay on the rules section:

* 63% said the rules were appropriate

* 64% said they were clear and easy to understand

Not bad, but I have a hard time believing nearly two thirds of you knobheads have ever read the rules.

As for fairness in moderation:

* 53% said we enforce the rules fairly

* 41% said we take feedback into account

* 56% trust us to make decisions that benefit the community

Eh, we could get elected on those numbers. Not bad.

And on something we've worked incredibly hard to preserve, subreddit culture:

* 57% said people generally behave (optimistc today, aren't we)

* 44% feel like a member of the subreddit

Confuscious once said, ""The man (or woman, get with the times) who thinks they are a member of WallStreetBets, and they who does not, are both right.""

~~~

I hope you guys enjoyed the results of our first survey, would love to get your insights on what's good and what isn't on WSB.

In preparation for the next survey, I will continue banning people until the numbers improve.

Finally, I'd like to end off with an anonymous quote from the survey:

""I'm on WallStreetBets to learn the dangers of YOLOing. I can safely say it's done a great job so far.""

Yeah okay, fuck you too cunt, and I'll see ya tomorrow.",OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR,156,1678331821.0

112bmqe,How $ASTS will become one of the best investments of the 2020s,"Around 3 months ago I wrote a DD piece on ASTS which can be found here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yvbi15/asts\_just\_went\_from\_speculative\_play\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yvbi15/asts_just_went_from_speculative_play_to/)

At that point Bluewalker3 had just unfurled, thereby reducing the tech risk to reasonable levels which gathered quite a bit of attention.

So how is the outlook 3 months after that major milestone?

In one word: **Extraordinary.**

And I don‚Äôt use that term lightly.

Let‚Äôs revisit some of the key topics.

1. Bluewalker 3 has now been on orbit for more than 3 months and is one of the most tracked satellites by hobbyists due to its sheer size and low earth orbit. In 3 months there have been no reports of abnormalities.

&#x200B;

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/b5l438ohy6ia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5879b51e8fa65f8293d6ea18738f7e9ed3b89b06)

Picture from Twitter user u/Astroguyz

&#x200B;

2) ASTS is expected to release details about connectivity in the coming weeks, which will most likely include the 1st ever video call using direct phone-to-satellite. This will be a monumental milestone which may or may not correlate with price movement. But it will definitely result in global news coverage for ASTS while leapfrogging them to the lead position of satellite communications.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/scz6rl9qy6ia1.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=92537e342e4e42feb7beec162ebd2f20688626e2

3) Recent weeks have seen a flurry of MNO (Mobile Network Operator) signing with ASTS. The total potential user count of ASTS services via their MNO partnerships now stands at 2.1 **BILLION** or 27% of the world population. Here‚Äôs a list published by ASTS CEO and also a list from Twitter Nomadbets showcasing the insanity of collaborations:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ma9vqrhty6ia1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=34a2ff32af05c70782cce33e270df712c6f8d76c

4) Existing partners like AT&T have recently ramped up their social ‚Äúshilling‚Äù of ASTS and are constantly teasing the upcoming satellite broadband products. It is awfully coincidental that AT&T started giving ASTS shoutouts while BW3 call testing is ongoing. Would they be so blatantly bullish if there was still a risk of ridicule of BW3 not delivering? I think it‚Äôs fairly obvious AT&T have seen the test results and are happy about it. These are just 2 tweets of many specifically aimed at ASTS.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/issaj8nwy6ia1.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f9aa7a8d0a221801d231d14c3c91101903017677

One of the executive VPs from AT&T was even showcased in a recent video talking at lengths about the unique relationship between AT&T and AST and how paramount it is for their rural coverage plans. Keep in mind that Sambar is at the helm of $20B in capex spendings from AT&T. This not just a PR dude giving us some buzzwords, this is the guy who typically signs the checks.

&#x200B;

5) The relationship with FCC and ASTS has improved substantially. One of the main ASTS contributors on AST subreddit has noticed that FCC is now often responding/approving ASTS requests within a 24 hour turnaround. It‚Äôs obvious that FCC has seen evidence of ASTS tech viability and now considers them a credible candidate to help with rural broadband coverage (which by the way is a huge political tailwind for many Senators from rural states)

6) ASTS recently secured the contract to launch 5 Bluebird satellites into orbit with SpaceX. BBs are a bigger version of BW3 which are currently being built and expected to launch before EOY. The company will need around 8-10 BBs in orbit to start generating significant revenue. With just 18 BBs in orbit they will be able to provide coverage to over 1 BILLION people.

7) Patent portfolio continues to increase at a fast clip. This is the textbook definition of a strong Moat. Once those satellites are in orbit and delivering EBIDTA at +90% profit margin it will be very, very, very hard to compete with ASTS without legal hurdles.

&#x200B;

8) AT&T and other MNOs have hinted at the vast applications for satellite communication within the US government. Here‚Äôs a tweet showcasing the very likely prospect of ASTS collaborating with the US Department of Defense.

9) There are many other scenarios in which Satellite broadband will be a game changer. Nomadbets for example did an excellent Twitter thread detailing how ASTS could cause a big splash within the Shipping industry.

10) Rakuten dedicated part of the Earnings call to satellite broadband. ASTS was specifically mentioned and Rakuten hinted at $2B in capital expenditures to make this collaboration happen.

Make no mistake: direct phone-to-satellite broadband is one of the mega trends of the 2020s and easily the most untapped revenue stream available to MNOs. They will jump through any hoops to work with ASTS. I'm proudly part of the SpaceMob! üëçüëç

&#x200B;

Bears, if you would like a nice little rub and tug, look no further. This post will explain why buying shares of leveraged volatility products cannot and will not go tits up.

I am down 37 bands since I last posted[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vj63p9/my_plan_for_intergenerational_wealth_uvxy_svxy/) 8 months ago. I haven't given up my thesis or my dollar cost averaging and I won‚Äôt until capitulation occurs, be it next year or next week. As I see it, the longer this equities bubble persists, the more time I have to build up my already quite large position. In this post I would like to discuss my perspective on: **Why the VIX is asleep, Hypothetical price targets for UVXY, and How my strategy has changed.**

Disclaimer: The 2x volatility index that I trade is below the $500mm market cap (or AUM in this case) allowed by WSB, so I will be focusing on UVXY for this post. Check my positions at the end of this post to see exactly what I am doing.

Another Disclaimer: I‚Äôm quite regarded. While my DD should be solid from a factual standpoint, only imitate my positions if you don‚Äôt mind the possibility of having a few extra inches added to the circumference of your anus.

Without Further ado.

**Why the VIX is Asleep**

As many of you may know, the VIX index is calculated using a very complex equation, but essentially is tracking the spread of options premiums on the SPX. In uncertain times or market downturns, as traders scramble for downside protection, these spreads can get sporadic and the VIX will spike.

So what gives? Why hasn‚Äôt there been a meaningful increase in the VIX index since the market has fallen \~20% last year? I mean, the VIX spiked over 150% with the Fed rate hikes in 2018 while the market dropped \~18% from September to December. Well the answer has to do with a worrying trend that has started getting out of hand in the past three quarters: institutional investors and hedge funds trading 0DTE options on the SPX. These types of trades create ample liquidity in the options market, rocketing the indices to new highs (remember when QQQ closed +7.35% on 11-10-22 ?) and suppressing the VIX index. This can lead to a vicious cycle with lower lows in the VIX begetting higher highs in the SPX, encouraging further 0DTE  gambling. But every cycle must come to an end‚Ä¶

[0DTE SPX volume at an all time high, while the VIX and VVIX make sharpest declines since Volmageddon](https://preview.redd.it/eassycii7sla1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=51dcdea114d3bee283968cec8b9b89bdb9bd0d44)

These types of trades generate large profits for the institutions who are able to sell far OTM options without posting collateral. However, as we all know, trading 0DTE comes with its risks. When the narrative regarding the economy changes (consumer debt is at all time highs, while household savings is nearing all time lows btw), or a large player in the 0DTE market leaves for whatever reason (drying up liquidity) hell will break loose. When the price stability in the options market goes haywire, VIX will spike. On top of this, scrambling for 0TE puts to hedge will drill the SPX as MMs need to sell SPX short to gamma hedge.

To conclude this section, trading 0DTE works very well‚Ä¶ until it doesn‚Äôt. Now onto the fun part: price targets.

**Price Targets**

First things first, this volatility spike will not be like Dec 2018. How can I be so sure? Well, because if it was, we would have seen it happen already. In early October 2018, the market reacted swiftly to Fed policy, with the VIX following closely behind.

[VIX reacts to market declines immediately in 2018](https://preview.redd.it/o0xiim3u7sla1.png?width=3785&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2b8960cae702ae056eb2b6da4769f1d31868beb3)

Compare this to what we see now. A sell off, comparable in percent decline, without the fireworks on the VIX:

[VIX stays calm despite 20&#37; drawdown](https://preview.redd.it/qlli2yfy7sla1.png?width=3767&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c25bdbd233a47be331dc7ef74efbe9856b338be9)

Okay, so VIX is dead, so what? Well I‚Äôd like to convince you that this is a premonition of something far more violent than the VIX spike in late 2018. I believe that this first 20% leg down was orderly selling by institutions, all of which are preparing for a monstrous capitulation in the coming year. I‚Äôd like to remind you that despite the fact that we are off of the all time highs of Jan 2022, we are still in a massive equities bubble that is only exacerbated by earnings contraction and the weakening consumer. Given that we are at the end of a 12 year secular bull run, I think it‚Äôs appropriate that we look at the behavior of the VIX in prior recessions.

**2001**

March 2000 to June 2001-- SPY: -22.7%, VIX: +40%

June 2001 to September 2002-- SPY: -38.1%, VIX: +113%

[VIX trades sideways until second leg sell-off](https://preview.redd.it/ybyjqrm28sla1.png?width=3781&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b205a5ed556446aa4d552df5013d6e0e29678e1)

**2008**

October 2007 to August 2008-- SPY: -16.7%, VIX: +3.3%

August 2008 to October 2008-- SPY: -24.8%, VIX: +419%

[VIX snoozes until MASSIVE spike during OCT '08 capitulation](https://preview.redd.it/nk2rnqq68sla1.png?width=3790&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=61d7edc7470c202d168b0ff18d02d0ab1efefc56)

It is apparent that when a big recession is brewing, the VIX will remain relatively tame during the first leg down, before exploding during the final capitulation. So what are my price targets for the coming capitulation?

**Price Targets**

I am going to use the historical prices of UVXY during the COVID crash to extrapolate what we may be able to expect from a leveraged volatility ETF during a full blown panic. I am aware that the COVID crash was a rather unique scenario, with the first pandemic in a century adding extra fear and volatility to the sell off on the way down. I am not here to argue about the exact price that VIX will reach, but given the recent 0DTE gambling, declining housing market, impending wars, persistent inflation, etc. I think it is reasonably realistic to use COVID crash as a model example (especially considering how much larger the bubble has gotten since 2020).

UVXY hit an intraday low of 105.5 on February 19, 2020. After a wild month of trading, UVXY topped out at 1350 on March 18, 2020. This astounding 1180% price increase is a testament to how extreme leveraged volatility ETFs can behave in uncertain times. But wait, UVXY is only a 1.5x leveraged VIX futures product. What if we wanted more leverage? Hypothetically, the 2x leveraged ETF that I own (that I shall not name) would return a staggering 1606%. This is like going from 16.18 (it‚Äôs closing price on Friday 3/3) to 276.06. Remember, this is just based on the COVID crash. Whether or not this next spike will come up short or surpass this return, no one can know. What I do know, is that your returns will likely be so significant that you cannot lose money buying shares of these products.

**WHY YOU CANNOT LOSE MONEY BUYING UVXY**

[A painful chart to look at](https://preview.redd.it/8ixiplob8sla1.png?width=2294&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bd8b848a17f2dfba201cd2d69cfb4f409213996a)

UVXY decays, we know. We also know that the return needed to break even on a losing trade becomes more and more daunting as your percent loss increases. For the sake of this DD or (perhaps more accurately) hardcore bear porn, please indulge with me. Imagine that on Monday a crash similar to COVID crash begins, it won‚Äôt, but just imagine. What does this mean? It means that over the next month, UVXY will go from 4.57 to 58.48, an 1180% return. Wow! If you bought on Friday at close, that's a great return! But let‚Äôs be real, that would never happen. We all know that timing the market is extraordinarily difficult. This is the number one reason I quit options. Suppose you still wanted to capture some of the return from that incredible spike in UVXY. Well, what if you dollar cost averaged? I can already hear the replies, ‚ÄúDCA in UVXY?!?!?! What a regard‚Äù and on and on. Well I think this strategy may have more merit than you give it credit for. Why? Two reasons: dollar cost averaging allows you to build up a massive position in UVXY (or another volatility product) while not having to time the crash. Sounds like a win-win.

Now, consider the chart I posted above. Consider that in order to break even on this hypothetical UVXY spike you would have had to buy UVXY and then sustain a 92% loss.

12.80x = 1

x= 0.078

1-x = 0.92 = 92%

Do you understand what this means?? It means that to lose money on this trade you would have to own shares of UVXY at an average share price of 58.49 or greater. A price not seen since May 2021! Jeez even I‚Äôm not \*that\* early on the trade. What‚Äôs more, is that you would have had to buy at that price and not have accumulated any more shares. If you so much as bought any shares after that date, you would be in the green due to a lower cost basis.

Now yes, this math works for the COVID crash scenario. Okay, well lets say UVXY only spikes a measly 800%. To break even you would need to buy at an 89% loss. That‚Äôs like buying UVXY at 41.13‚Ä¶ again, in May 2021.

Reference the chart above for other scenarios, but I think you get the picture. Keep this in mind as you consider the percent drawdown in my positions (aka unrealized loss porn) below. Know that my cost basis decreases weekly.

**TO CONCLUDE**

The 4 phase plan is the same as it‚Äôs been with a minor change. I will:

1. DCA into a volatility product until capitulation
2. Put earnings into SVXY or similar index and ride the volatility back down
3. **Put money into QQQ** (instead of SPY) with as much margin as I can get
4. Wait for the real estate market to bottom and buy a house

And the most damning evidence that this trade will work:

118846m,The 'Canadian Warren Buffett' warns tech stocks are more overvalued than during the dot-com bubble - and predicts a painful selloff," 

* Growth stocks are more overvalued today than during the dot-com boom, Prem Watsa warned.
* The ""Canadian Warren Buffett"" said tech stocks appear hugely overpriced relative to value stocks.
* The billionaire investor and Fairfax Financial chief cautioned growth stocks could tumble.

""Valuations of value-oriented stocks versus growth stocks, particularly technology, have never been so extreme, exceeding even the extremes of the dot-com era in 2000,"" Prem Watsa said. ""As the economy continues to normalize, we expect a reversion to the mean with value-oriented stocks coming to the fore.""

Watsa is the founder and CEO of Fairfax Financial, an insurance conglomerate with a billion-dollar stock portfolio that's often compared to Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. He issued his grim outlook for US growth stocks during a fourth-quarter earnings call on Friday, according to a transcript provided by Sentieo/AlphaSense.

The value investor said on the call that his company's stock holdings remain deeply undervalued, but he expects that to change. He noted that Fairfax's portfolio doubled in value between 2000 and 2002, while the major US stock indices roughly halved during that period.

The value investor also pointed out that despite the market's rally this year, Big Tech stocks like Amazon and Tesla are still down sharply from their peaks in 2021. Moreover, their smaller peers like Zoom and Shopify have regained even less ground.

""If history is any guide, there's more to come,"" Watsa said. ""I will note for you that the Nasdaq dropped 50% in 2000 and then dropped another 50% in the next 2 years.""

Fairfax and Berkshire have several key holdings in common, including Bank of America, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum. Watsa also shares Buffett's love of highly concentrated bets: seven stocks including Blackberry accounted for nearly 90% of Fairfax's $4 billion portfolio at the end of December.

For those of you that don‚Äôt know JPOW testifies to congress tomorrow and Wednesday. This is a yearly thing that he has done since at least 2021. 

In 2021 we saw a red day, however, in 2022 we saw a pretty big green day putting in nearly 2%... the question we have to ask is‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwill markets listen to jpow and interrupt what he is saying as hawkish finally? Or is this going to be like the last 3-4 times he spoke where the markets had blinders on?‚Äù  
 

Based on the last 2 weeks of downtrend (outside of Thursday and Friday) I honestly think markets (and more importantly the algos) are more ready to accept a hawkish JPOW and are more ready to sell off depending on what he says. 

**SPY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/si3wu0ylu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6ab668ddf7ff2144e42753f313ee8fa3f0f6ce79

Taking a look at supply and demand here on SPY daily if you remember I said one of the more short term bullish but longer term bearish scenarios was that SPY would come up and take out 405.74 demand from 2/10. We did just that today. Now what is important is what happens next. With this evening doji star pattern here and the techicals pointing to a new supply being established soon‚Ä¶ IF spy closes below todays low there is a very good chance we are going to see this 405.74 demand turned into supply. Turning a demand into supply (resistance) is extremely bearish and would cement not only this level but would also cement a lower supply than the previous ones up in that 414-417 area. 

All eyes remain on tomorrows close to see what that technical show. If we establish this 405.2 as supply tomorrow then my ultimate target realistically is 396.5 supply from 2/24. If we can take that supply (currently support) out and turn it into a new demand or reconfirm previous demand (support) at 394.88 that would be very bullish going forward. I would 1000% play a bounce from that 395/396 area back to 405. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACITON** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u3xonzgmu6ma1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=50898a962a4cc631bc1dd452007575247668c619

Looking at the daily chart here everything is screaming put here. This evening doji star pattern is one of the highest probability setups for a put. If it wasn‚Äôt for jpow speaking tomorrow and Wednesday and my overall lack of trust in this market and the fact that pre markets have seen some incredibly volatile overnight swings‚Ä¶ I would 1000% be in at least a 14-30dte put. I fully expect the 400 support area (which is the daily 200ema) to be retested this week when we see a structure like this. 

SPY:

Supply- 396.46 -> 414.13  
 Demand- 394.68 -> 388.52  
 Daily Support- 404.4 -> 399.7 -> 397.8  
 Daily Resistance- 405.3 -> 407.2 -> 408.2

**FUTURES SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kghecwxmu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c8640f69408460d40fc5c31b037600d283305992

Now if you remember on futures last week we had taken out previous demand and now we are officially in a no mans land. We either need to find the extra strength to push to 4096 before we establish a new supply (resistance) short of that. OR we need to establish a new supply (resistance) and come take out lower supply at 4015/ 3991.

For me personally based on the technical and daily price action we should turn todays candle into a supply (resistance) here at 4055. Doing so will then open up a retrace to ‚Äútake out‚Äù previous supplies at 4015 and 3990. IF we take those out and can establish a new demand before retesting 3960 then I would like a push back to 4096. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qcfyqydnu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=82c9045d96792ed6ddcd70116dab96d8101a62e1

taking a look at futures daily price action here are one could imagine the candles are similar to spy (which isn‚Äôt always the case) and we are actually seeing a pretty significant reversal candle set up here too. With the SPY and Futures daily reversal set ups I would be surprised to not see a retrace to minimally 4020 tomorrow. 4020 is currently where the daily 8, 50 and 200ema sit. However, there is a chance with JPOW speaking tomorrow that the algos could do something funky which obviously would result in a breaking of technical. 

Again if it wasn‚Äôt for JPOW I would have felt pretty darn comfortable in overnight 25-30dte puts. But little reason to take the risk. 

Futures: 

Supply- 3990 -> 4015 -> 4160  
 Demand- 3920 -> 3960 -> 4096  
 Daily support- 4050 -> 3983  
 Daily resistance- 4085 -> 4095 -> 4113

**VIX**

&#x200B;

Overall the VIX is still in a down trend here as you can see. However, it put in a really nice inside day today. Historically speaking inside days result in continuation but is not always the case. 

I mentioned on Friday that the 18.2 support touch on Friday should have resulted in a VIX bounce which is clearly did. However, that apparently did not account for the fact that SPY wouldn‚Äôt care that the VIX was green all day long too‚Ä¶ nor would it account for the fact that yields once again were elevated again while SPY was green. 

The only thing that played correctly was that DXY was down just slightly today while SPY was green.

Absolutely a great way to start off the week! No complaints at all. I got burnt as you can see twice in calls though. The first one I stopped myself out of when we were playing around that 406.5 to 407.3 morning/ mid day chop‚Ä¶ I entered a call on support (what I thought was) and price action broke a key level. I took my exit and then of course it pushed to HOD. Tough bounce but was the right play and the right stop loss. 

Only other loss today was a stop out when we  bounced off support and once again had a fake break down.

The morning was extremely frustrating to trade as we were seeing that VOLD was extremely bearish along with the VIX and the yields, however, SPY continued to push up. Made for some choppy trading. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p7qhh2npu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2425feb7b9e7181bf8ca9e5ec81648a6beab44ad

However, the best play of the day was the 1225am retest of 407.3 resistance. I saw it as a short opportunity and took a beautiful 9.4% win. I ended up closing for profits when we came back down and were holding 405.3 support at 1pm. I actually was looking for a bigger recovery back up to 407 again. However, EOD actually ended up being fairly bearish. 

I am bearish to neutral. If bulls take back 405.3 tomorrow then I would be bullish until we touch 4096 supply. However, I feel fairly confident unless jpow pumps us tomorrow that we establish a new supply and will push back to that 3990/4015 area this week.

11jyvi0,"Tesla stock will sell off this month after 'off the chart' rally as retail investors lose excitement over Elon Musk, research firm says","*  Vanda Research sees a sell-off coming for Tesla stock later this month after a hot start to 2023.¬†
* Retail investors have piled into the EV-maker's stock, but Elon Musk's recent announcements fell flat.
* ""The current environment is more favorable for a sell-off, given the sizable investment flows in comparison to historical levels.""

Tesla stock has had a red-hot start to 2023 thanks to enormous retail investor interest, but Elon Musk's announcements this week could end up sparking a sell-off rather than more enthusiasm, according to Vanda Research.¬†

In a note following Musk's latest colorful statements at the company's investor day, Vanda forecasted that Tesla shares will see a decline in overall purchases in the near term.

Shares of the EV-maker declined 6% Thursday. So far this year, Tesla stock has gained more than 80% following 2022's brutal performance.

""\[Th\]e monthly purchases of TSLA by retail investors are off the chart, likely attributable to a combination of relatively low perceived price and excitement surrounding Musk's Master Plan,"" the strategists said.

Tesla (TSLA) has had a red-hot start to 2023 thanks to enormous retail investor interest ($14 billion in shares purchased), but Elon Musk's announcements last week could end up sparking a sell-off rather than more enthusiasm, per Vanda Research.

1139q8l,Buy the dip continues‚Ä¶ 2-15-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,"Today was another one of those days where it was a clear buy the dip narrative. However, it was clearly not presented that way yet again. Now I know basically for the last week or 2 its been every dip is a rip‚Ä¶ and honestly IF you went into the day with only the mentality that every dip is an opportunity for a call and you didn‚Äôt look at any other technicals or supporting evidence then you would probably be profitable. 

However, these sell offs are becoming more and more convincing and more and more supported from a technical standpoint. This isnt just a small retrace in price action to reconfirm support. These are pretty large retraces taking out major support and having a lot of supporting technical that they will continue. However, much like yesterday as soon as those technical show continuation we are getting absolutely rogue out of no where rips and then eventually technical come back to support the bull side. 

IT has become increasingly frustrating to trade SPY over the last 2 weeks now. There is absolutely no continuation and the technicals just don‚Äôt make a whole lot of sense at all. Major supports/ resistances breaking with support of price action and technicals are seeing rogue reversals before we finally get the actual movement one would expect. 

The more I look at the last 2 weeks of price action we are stuck in a range. However, this range is heavily being held together by the buy the dip narrative. There has been countless opportunities and supporting evidence of a large correction sub 405 coming on SPY since last week and we still manage to stay afloat some how.

We do get some more data in the AM with initial jobless claims and PPI. Will be curious if this PPI final demand expected a 0.4% with a previous of -0.5% will be negatively received‚Ä¶ the feds have said how much they rely on PPI so a hotter or rebounding PPI COULD potentially finally see a retrace. 

But that‚Äôs only if the buy the dip narrative ends‚Ä¶ 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/za8k35dccfia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=72fc0880713eee2a1189f09d8486eda10d9ecb97

Looking at SPY here that range I am referring to since February 1st is 405 to 417. 

Overall we haven‚Äôt broken through either of those levels over the last 11 trading days now. The question still does remain 420 or 405 next? The case for 420 grows in my opinion. 

Something I wanted to highlight here on SPY was the post CPI trends from December and January. In December we had that CPI day that resulted in that massive candle. The following day we closed a small red day and then the day after that was a massive red day. Looking at January we had that range day much like this previous CPI yesterday. The next day was a bullish engulfing day (much like today). The following day resulted in a reversal doji that then was proceeded by a huge sell off. 

I will be curious to see if this trend continues or not. 

When we look at the daily we have an 8ema bounce and we have a bullish engulfing candle candle‚Ä¶ that SHOULD push SPY higher and possibly retest that critical 417 resistance. That would be my target tomorrow if markets don‚Äôt negatively react to that data. 

We are still in that breakout triangle with support at 409.5 and resistance at 414.4.

Key SPY Support- 410.2 -> 408.6 -> 405.4

Key SPY Resistance- 414.1 -> 416.8 -> 419.5

Futures shows quite the consolidation here itself too but what futures shows that SPY doesn‚Äôt show very much of is these massive wicks to the downside. This means that futures is seeing some pretty impressive sell offs after hours/ during market close, however, intraday is pumping back up. 

This has happened quite a few times before and this usually signifies that eventually a change of tide is coming‚Ä¶ 

I have noticed a lot times when after hours/ futures don‚Äôt match the intraday movement of Spy there is an imbalance in the markets‚Ä¶ in my opinion generally speaking futures is rarely wrong‚Ä¶ it just takes them some times to be right. 

Taking a look here we are holding that same consolidation on futures as spy from 4085 to 4193. 

We remain also in this breakout wedge pattern here with tomorrows resistance being at 4180 and support being at 4105.

Key levels to watch though that we have seen a lot of price action at is 4123 support and 4178 resistance. 

Key Futures Support- 4140 -> 4123 -> 4105

Key Futures Resistance- 4160 -> 4178 -> 4193

Somewhat surprising today Tesla actually didn‚Äôt show a lot of strength‚Ä¶ it held within a fairly tight $2 closing range for a large portion of the day. However, after a sell off during Bidens speech it found all the strength it needed and made a massive push up to close at that key 215 daily 200ema resistance area. 

Tesla did close out a classic hanging man candle which could result in a drop tomorrow. However, with Spy and Tesla both finishing at their HODs tomorrow we could be set up for a large push up tomorrow. 

I still believe its far too early to short tesla but I also believe whenever this buy the dip narrative pops Tesla will be the ultimate short. 

Key Tesla Support- 209.5 -> 202.8 -> 197.2 -> 191.9

Key Tesla Resistance- 215 -> 219.1 -> 226.1 -> 229.8

Interesting close here on the VIX today back under that key pivot level of 18.3‚Ä¶ If we look at the VIX this is only the second time in over 13 months that the VIX has CLOSED below 18.3‚Ä¶ Everytime since January that the VIX has closed under 18.3 the following day the VIX has had a very large rebound. 

January 13th -> January 17th 5.51% VIX rebound and -0.18% red day followed by -1.58% red day for SPY  
 January 27th -> January 30th 7.73% VIX rebound and -1.25% red day for SPY   
 February 1st -> February 2nd 4.82% VIX rebound and 1.46% green day for spy followed by -1% red day  
 February 3rd -> February 6th 6% VIX rebound and -0.61% red day for SPY

What is actually the most interesting about this pattern is that all but one of those has happened over a weekend. 

Most of the rebounds on VIX resulted in a simultaneous red day for SPY but two times it was one day later. 

Speaking of SPY drops here is some fun facts‚Ä¶ 

SPY has not put in 3 red days in a row since January 17-19th. Before that the last 3 red days in a row came December 14th to 17th. Both of these were immediately proceeding CPI results. 

Spy has only closed back to back red days 6 total times in the last 39 trading days‚Ä¶ 

We also have only close > -2% one time since November 9th which was over 3 months ago now. 

With 11 trading days of consolidation within about a $10 range we are very soon going to see a move up or down.

Started the day off fairly well today. Got burnt in that morning call on a failed breakout‚Ä¶ I cut early at -7.6% which was the right move as we had a very large correction then. From there I made a few more nice trades and then I got absolutely burnt by the market. 

I took a call around noon at what looked like the perfect support bounce at a key level only for the bottom to fall out on me. l then took a put around 1230 after SPY looked like it was confirming resistance and pretty much every indicator I have screamed puts only for SPY to get an absolute rogue shrek and of course wrecked that put. 

Highly frustrating trading lately. Actually put in my 3rd red day in a row here in a very long time. I looked back through my logs and honestly I couldn‚Äôt even find a time that I had 3 red days in a row between now and last May. Quite a few back to back red days but even during my terrible drawdown in July to September I didn‚Äôt put in 3 red days in a row. Definitely struggling this week with this price action and these reversals/ fake outs but we just keep on trucking.

I said it this morning and I say it every day‚Ä¶ play what the market gives‚Ä¶ yes 100% we need to take into consideration the macro movements intraday but going into a day fully biased is not a smart idea.

Looking at this article here it appears there is a market wide bank liquidity crunch starting. That fear could have been the driving force behind this sell off‚Ä¶ (for anyone who didn‚Äôt see SIVBs option chain EOD today one of the puts was up 500k% which I think is the biggest gain I have ever seen on a single options trade‚Ä¶). 

The question know is as these banks and assets firms start to fall.. whos next? How big will this go? Could this be our black swan event? Stay tuned to find out‚Ä¶

Honestly one of the most incredible things about this nearly -2% drop and total $10.95 HOD to LOD sell off is that the chances of a 50bps has severely decreased from around 80% before the jobless data was released this morning until market close today. Not only that but the 10YR sold off with SPY today and so did DXY. 

That is very interesting thing to note about this sell off for sure and will be critical to watch as we close the week out tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f3prnu0pnsma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4b6bf1c2c312d20a8b25ea77c6ed38a902291250

Tomorrow is another incredibly important data day that should move the markets. We are going to get employment report (nonfarm payroll), the unemployment rate and also the wages data. These numbers are going to be what put the odds of a 50bps back at 80% or down to 25% or lower EOD tomorrow‚Ä¶ Not only that we are going to get the all so important (to me at least) CPI consensus released tomorrow. 

Knowing the Friday morning data should give investors a chance to know what the 25 or 50bps rate hike will be. Plus this will give us a better sneak peek of what CPI YoY/ MoM will be. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cl4rxdgpnsma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5383b3ccc427e81d31ba15cdbad0313191170037

Bears put in an impressive show today and took us under not only 394.64 demand (support) but took us below the low from last weeks sell off. It took 3 days to go from 392.3 to 407.45 and took 3 days to go right back to these levels (and lower). 

From a demand and supply stand point we are in the waiting period. We have potential to establish a new demand, however, we need minimally one green day if not two before we will see that happen. The biggest thing I am watching here is that 388.52 demand (support). Not only that but as you can see we have that previous supply at 383.82 sitting there still. 

This 383.82 could very well be a down side target. With us being 2% from that level IF we get bearish data in the morning (this would be data that shows a STRONG economy) which would be a very low UE rate and very high wages then I would actually not be too surprised to see us push all the way down to that level. 

From a bullish stand point the bulls ideal situation here would be a break down to 383.82 and then a massive bounce (which would come Monday) to then turn that level into a demand (support). Turning a previous supply (and taking a hanging supply like this off the books) into a demand would establish a very strong support area and would be extremely bullish going forward. 

From a bearish standpoint we are still working our way down and right now there is very little reason to bet on a bounce. Momentum is carrying us down and we are at least two trading days away from any sort of sustained bounce. Bears would like to get this under 388.52 demand and possibly take out that supply. There ideal situation would then be a short bounce back to either 388.52 or 394.68 to then turn that into supply (resistance) before seeing a lower push. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ke13841qnsma1.png?width=888&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=27a7d370ba40efb197acbfdd87449c6044660c06

Both of these are a daily chart here but zoomed way out to show you better just how actually bearish this breakdown today was. 

So from a very zoomed out stand point we broke the black support line. What is the significance of that black support line? Well this is the recovery line from the October low to last weeks low. We have now broke then again which should and could signify further downside to go. 

Not only that but we were working on a shorter timeframe blue/black breakout/down triangle that we have now officially lost support on. And the red falling wedge that we were trading within has also had its support broken. Many many supports and key levels being broken today. 

The one key level that did not break and we came within 43 cents of is the key pivot point of 390.1. We did come close to it yet we failed to break through it. This will be the major level to watch tomorrow. 

With this rejection off the daily 20ema and closing once again back below the 8, 20, 50, 100 and 200ema there are two ways to see this‚Ä¶ 

The first choice is to see this as a clear consolidation area from 390 to 405 (one could even infer there is a 390 to 414 consolidation area that dates back to beginning of January). If you see this as a consolidation whether short or longer timeframe then this is officially your bounce and call opportunity area. 

However, if you see this as a clear lower high (420 -> 392 -> 406 -> 390) then this is the start of an even bigger sell off. 

Now the one wildcard (well two) that we have here is all the data tomorrow and then CPI print next Tuesday. This is a fairly tough place for markets to be in and even tougher for investors. My personal thoughts are that as long as we maintain 390 support and we don‚Äôt see incredibly bearish (strong economy data) tomorrow then we should hold 390 and relief bounce back to the 393-395 area to close the week out. However, IF we get massively bearish data tomorrow then I would set my ultimate target at 383.8 supply. 

SPY Levels: 

Supply: 383.82 -> 405.17  
 Demand: 394.68 -> 388.52 -> 376.67  
 Daily Support: 390.1 -> 388.7 -> 387.2 -> 385.2  
 Daily Resistance: 394.7 -> 395.5 -> 397.8

**FUTURE DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pbja3gtsnsma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5db851eaa7cf5a8f93ceceb9c0a3a73490236913

Now look at futures we have an absolutely beautiful support bounce of 3920. I am first of incredibly impressed we broke through 3960 and even hit 3920 but Its even more impressive that we held it the way we did. 

Bulls have a real opportunity here on futures to reconfirm this as a demand (support) which would be incredibly bullish and would in my opinion certainly lead to an upside push. 

The structure here on futures is actually slightly different than SPY supply/ demand in the sense that instead of having a downside supply to take out we have a wide open gap on the daily futures chart from current 3920 demand (support) to 3833 demand (support). 

If the bears target a downside push tomorrow that would be where I would start to eye which would be a -2.3%. Now that is a pretty big target, however, if we get really bearish data its possible for sure. 

Bears goal would be a closure somewhere between 3833 and 3920 tomorrow to then turn around and short bounce back to 3920 or 3960 and turn that demand into a supply (new resistance). If they do that they very well could target the 3600-3700s‚Ä¶ IF data supports the move. 

Bulls goal tomorrow is to double bottom futures of 3920 (that means a closure over 3920 but preferably over 3960). They then want to reconfirm 3920 as demand (which means as least 2 days of green) and start a push back to 4055. 

**FUTURE DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gnqe6bbtnsma1.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=93d2ad00170d4f081e813396ff3172d899c84eff

From a weekly price action stand point similar break down here on futures through the October recovery blue support line and also falling out of the breakout/down triangle. For those of you that do not remember 3920 is the incredibly important pivot point that is similar to that of 390.1. With futures stopping and more importantly closing over that 3920 today that is actually somewhat bullish as this could as I said under spy be a bigger 3920-4095 range that we are once again finding bottom in. 

However, if this sell of continues we have some pretty strop support to watch for in the 3810-3830 range that would be my ultimate downside target. 

Futures levels-

Supply: 4055 -> 4160  
 Demand: 3960 -> 3920 -> 3833  
 Daily support: 3920 -> 3895 -> 3872 -> 3830  
 Daily Resistance- 3955 -> 3990

**SPY/ FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY/ DEMAND TEASER** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/61cwmbvtnsma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fdbd2f68b0622c6aec0d2d7cbb587914c7d45df8

From a weekly standpoint here spy is looking at a target of 382.2 as its closest level. If bulls can close us short of that and close us green next week we actually could see a new higher demand (support) established here which could open up the upside back to that 412.5 area. 

However, on futures we have lost critical 3971 demand (support) and now are closing in on 3864 demand (support). That would be a more reasonable -1.5% target for tomorrow. From there bulls if they can hold that level which is major support from the December lows we could (Again if data supports) see  a bounce and weekly double bottom off 3864. In the off chance that 3971 is recovered tomorrow we could see futures weekly barcode and potentially either turn a double bottom off 3971 back to 4055 or start the descent to 3864 then. 

Its hard to have a true answer of where this will go when this market is so sensitive and data dependent right now. 

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iiqq7a9xnsma1.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c046c9f63804020a4b6057b2eafd26154529acaa

The most impressive thing about the vix is that prior to this breakout it actually came down and perfectly touched that support line for the breakout/down triangle before it had a massive breakout. With an 18.62% green close today this is the biggest move the VIX has seen since June 13th 2022 which was a 22.67% green move up‚Ä¶ If you remember this time period was around rate hike/ cpi news. 

Also for reference that day on SPY it closed -3.8% red‚Ä¶ vs the relatively small -1.84% red day spy had today‚Ä¶ 

This also the highest level the VIX has been since February 22nd . With data tomorrow IF that data comes in extremely bearish we could very well see the VIX push even higher tomorrow until we get the CPI reading next Tuesday. 

However, one thing that‚Äôs interesting to note is that almost every single time the VIX does have a massive breakout like this it within 1-2 days has a sizeable retrace. 

Something else that I find intriguing is that the VIX spiked today but did not earlier in the week with the 50bps news and everything else. This tells me that markets truly do not believe we get at 50bps, however, markets are fearful a bank liquidity crisis. 

**DXY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tkjvt3uunsma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=69e9f8d86f759be14e796bbdfcd1e3a778a0fc64

Not a whole lot to report today on DXY besides it did hard reject off that 105.6 doji from yesterday and is now coming back down to test its daily 8ema support. We are still maintaining its rising wedge and will continue to watch to see if this or the 10YR breaks support before CPI next week. 

**10YR Yield**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/01efih7vnsma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c02788f4930c142efda1e996aff76eabdba2f065

Now this is where its interesting to look and see the difference between everything that is happening. The 10yr had a -2.15% drop today which is a very large sell off considering SPY put in nearly a 2% red day‚Ä¶ this tells us that markets are not as worried about inflation and the 50bps hike as they were earlier this week. With this rising wedge finally broken on 10YR I will be watching DXY closely and we very well as I have said see a CPI rally into FOMC.

I once again‚Ä¶ twice‚Ä¶ found myself being sold heavily on the fake bullish breakout before a massive sell off occurred. ](https://preview.redd.it/15quc5nvnsma1.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d177fa2e4ad4b7271b389cb15d70eee68cbc3ac6)

I didn‚Äôt trade anything after 1pm today as by that point I honestly just couldn‚Äôt find an entry that looked good enough (it realistically never pulled back far enough to not be FOMO for me), I stopped trusting the sell off and then I had to take off early before EOD. 

It was a good day in the sense that I followed my rules and once again didn‚Äôt break them. I also cut my losers early this time which along with a -10% stop loss has been incredibly helpful in my trading results. 

Tomorrow once again is a new day and we will once again see what this incredibly unpredictable market will bring us.",DaddyDersch,117,1678402871.0

11b2uqn,The Kangaroo market continues‚Ä¶ 2-24-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,"Well this morning as expected we got some HOT HOT HOT PCE data and not very strong personal income/ spending data‚Ä¶ and no surprise markets did not take that well and actually had one hell of a red open. WE are seeing some extremely aggressive pre market swings the last week or so. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dpi68720h7ka1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=71b7ce1ddf9ce7252594d6e42ea36279fe0dd5a1

The biggest story of the week really is the fact that markets has now given FOMC a 30% chance of a 50bps rate hike in march‚Ä¶ Now do I actually believe that will happen? No not really‚Ä¶ however, I do believe that with the way PCE data and everything else is coming in this week that we are going to see an upside miss on CPI. The most probable scenario I am seeing here is that we are flat to red around 380-390 leading into CPI‚Ä¶ CPI misses to upside and we touch 360-370s. However FOMC will come in with a 25bps rate hike and that will lead to a market wide rally back to 390. 

The algos this week were definitely on another level‚Ä¶ 

&#x200B;

The bulls attempted to break SPY back over the daily 100ema today and even made a convincing run for it there at the EOD. However, we did reject and we are now closing below the daily 100ema for the first time since January 19th. 

There is an extreme red bear channel with support at 388.2 and resistance at 396.7 for Monday. However, the bigger broader bear channel gives support at 392.5 on Monday. 

Even though this sell off has felt like a lot more‚Ä¶ we have actually only dropped about 5% over 7 days total‚Ä¶ and besides Tuesday really none of it has been continuous. This has been one of the most choppy dumps I have seen on spy in a while. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u0kf08z0h7ka1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8622ea041f21031ae89c2b410587aab6334da506

I personally think that the SPY weekly chart is the big story and is telling of what to come here this next week and March. We had a support line dating back to the October bottom and January consolidation area that we lost support on this week. Breaking this pretty massive rising wedge absolutely opens downside. 

Something I mentioned a long time ago was that with the JPM collar historically we see a trend for the first 7 weeks post roll and that is the peak or trough and then we see a retrace of that said trend until week 11. Currently SPY is playing that out perfectly which means we have 2 more weeks of consolidation/ dropping. 

We also just closed SPY below the weekly 8 and 20ema support for the first time since December. When you look back at SPY anytime we close below the 8ema and especially the 20ema it usually leads to a good sized retrace. 

My main target remains 390 support on SPY. However, if we were to break through that I would start looking at 383 support next. 

Key Weekly SPY Support- 396.3 -> 390.2 -> 393.2

Key Weekly SPY Resistance- 398.8 -> 402.6 -> 407.2

&#x200B;

I actually believe that futures daily shows a far more bearish story here than SPY daily does. IF you look at the futures daily here we have what I have coined the classic ‚Äú123 rollercoaster.‚Äù What that means is we have an initial break down (1) (this would be the move from 4160 to 3985) and then we have the relieve bounce (2) (this is the move from 3985 to 4035) and then we get the continuation of the initial move (3) (this would be touching 3920 area. 

This week we saw that massive Tuesday bounce, and really we consolidated, attempted to retake the daily 200 and 50ema, however we rejected and actually now will be closing below the daily 100ema. With Futures (and SPY) closing below the daily 8, 20, 50, 100, and 200ema for the first time since January 5th we should absolutely look for further downside. We have a classic bearish 8/20ema crossover and we lost, retested and rejected the daily 200ema which should also be seen as very bearish. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l4tc9kw1h7ka1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f91b474cc1c764362a1247486ab32143ebe72ffe

Similar idea here on the futures weekly chart. We are seeing a classic breakdown with a close below the 8, 20, 50 and 100ema supports. With that rejection and losing the key upside resistance at 4095 (407.3 on spy) we should be looing for a retest of mean which is that 3920 area on futures (390.1 on spy). 

Key Weekly Futures Support- 3975 -> 3920 -> 3860

Key Weekly Futures Resistance- 4020 -> 4080 ->  4095

Honestly tesla daily here is a tough one and a frustrating one. We are finally seeing weakness and we actually closed below that key support of 197.1 which should be a big deal specially closing our first full candle below the daily 8ema‚Ä¶ with overall market weakness and assumingly risk coming off in the market Tesla should be one of the biggest to fall‚Ä¶ However, it is still showing quite impressive daily strength. Last bulls support is going to be that 192 support. There is still a chance that tesla is just ranging from 192 to 215 and realistically I don‚Äôt like any plays here till one of those hard breaks. 

&#x200B;

Weekly wise here actually very similar to Meta we are seeing more of a bull flag/ bullish support bounce set up then I am on SPY and other tickers like Apple, MSFT, and Amzn. Now the biggest thing here is that this is an inside weekly candle on Tesla which generally speaking does lead to further upside. However, this is clearly at a decision point too. With Tesla still holding its 8, 20 and 200ema support here I have a hard time wanting to be long on puts on it just yet. IF tesla loses 189.8 and realistically 178 then the downside move is going to be large and aggressive. 

Tesla Weekly Support- 189.8 -> 178 -> 164

Tesla Weekly Resistance- 208.4 -> 226.6

&#x200B;

The VIX gives us a whole lot of noting here too. On one hand this is clearly a inverted hammer/ hanging man candle and generally speaking could be seen as a downside candle for VIX or upside move for SPY. However, take a look at Friday on the VIX‚Ä¶ obviously different setup but similar idea of downside on the VIX however, it immediately bounced. 

The issue is that there is SO much 0dte activity the VIX isnt staying elevated or moving like it used to. Yes at times it perfectly tracks and I believe we can enter/ exit with its supporting our move. However, people are piled in 30+ dte puts like we used to see‚Ä¶ people are piling into 0-7dte puts here and then immediately exiting sometimes the same day when they are right. That‚Äôs exactly what happened on Thursday‚Ä¶ if you didn‚Äôt see the article there was a whale who bought 26k of 0dte 4000puts on ES futures that caused that massive $6 meltdown‚Ä¶ once he sold (took profits) on those we have a massive $6 rally. 

We are seeing it a lot lately with these irrational breakouts, 50 cent instant moves on SPY and just overall nonsense. 0dte is nice but honestly it is kinda ruining the market at times.

Honestly just a frustrating day trading and frustrating week trading. I started the week off pretty deep in the hole thanks to those 0dte ES calls I swang that got absolutely rocked. From there the biggest issue here was that the moves were so damn aggressive and so dang fast that by time I liked what I saw and clicked confirm/ send the premiums had already jumped 20-30 cents at a time. It was a snooze you loose trading all week long. 

And then of course the ones I did get in on absolutely got theta ate and I either ended up in the red and stop lossed or by time the move was done it got theta ate so much it never saw profits. 

One change that I have been considering for a long time is going to a -10% stop loss instead of -15%... I actually moved from a -20% to -15% sometimes end of 2022 and that was a big positive change for me. However, with these 0dte every day the pay out on premiums and moves is so small we aren‚Äôt seeing the same profits we used to. Not only that a day like today with extremely high IV only moved a total of $3.61 all day (intraday) that leaves absolutely no room for reward either. 

Its kinda crazy as I was talking to my friend about ‚Äúwhat changed‚Äù when I went from 10-15% average wins to 3-5% wins.. and my answer was nothing‚Ä¶ I looked back and the very week that SPY 0dte every day hit the markets my average win and average profits all took a huge loss. Win rate never really changed but I went from averaging 10-15% on most wins (using 3-4dte) to barely getting 5% most trades before it either reverses, iv crushes or theta eats me. 

This market is ever changing and ever frustrating. But in the end it‚Äôs a marathon not a sprint. And as I said all of 2022‚Ä¶ everyone should be looking at capital preservation so that in 2024 or 2025 when a bull market comes back you have the funds to finally get the reward that most are missing out on.",DaddyDersch,118,1677274644.0

8am. Stop at the new latt√© place near work. The coffee is terrible, nobody likes it, and they‚Äôre struggling to stay afloat. Give them a $120 million investment and tell them not to change a thing. Smart. I‚Äôve got in on the ground floor.
 
Midday. Yesterday was Super Bowl Sunday. Philadelphia lost. This seems like an excellent time to buy up all the failed bets on Philadelphia winning... Spent my lunch hour buying up more losing bets from betters weirdly keen to sell them to me. Some take just cents in the dollar. If somehow the Philies are post-facto awarded last week‚Äôs Superbowl ‚Äì these bets will be worth a fortune. I‚Äôll have bagged myself a bargain. Gosh I‚Äôm clever.
 
3pm. Receive a tipoff that the SEC has Coinbase in its crosshairs and would like nothing more than to see it regulated out of existence. They say you‚Äôd have to be crazy to buy Coinbase shares right now. I buy more Coinbase shares.

Tomorrow for those of you who don‚Äôt know is FOMC minutes at 2pm‚Ä¶ JPOW will NOT be speaking.. its just a release of what was said essentially at the last meeting. 

&#x200B;

Taking a look at SPY daily here we actually are looking at a really impressive down trend over the last 3 days now. Now this blue resistance line sits at 400.2 for tomorrow which means bears got about $1 of upside to still hold same down trend. This also is the first time spy has closed 3 red days in a row since January which funny enough was right after CPI‚Ä¶ Actually what truly is crazy is that the trend from last CPI to this CPI is identical. The bears impressively enough were able to close us back under the daily 200ema also today. 

We had a doji CPI day -> small \~0.3% green day -> then 3 red days in a row. 

If trend follows then SPY could be in for a massive green day tomorrow‚Ä¶

We have to factor in FOMC minutes‚Ä¶ now that a 50bps hike is on the table (last I checked was about 20% priced in), with CPI and PPI data coming in hotter than expected and PMI this morning coming in bearish‚Ä¶ we very well could see a negative reaction to FOMC minutes. However, much like most FOMC days the reaction to FOMC minutes generally speaking is bullish. 

For me looking at the daily here now that we have lost 405.3 and closed under it I am bearish back to 390. There is always a chance we get a retest of 405.3 resistance first however, losing 405.3 should open up a retest of 390 support. 390 is a major pivot point in this market and depending on our timing reaching it and the next CPI/ FOMC could start a catalyst for further downside or for a recover back to the 400s. 

Key SPY Support- 399.1 -> 396.6 -> 395.9 -> 393.6

Key SPY Resistance- 401 -> 403.2

&#x200B;

Futures actually has a similar looking pattern with a closure under the daily 200ema and this bigger falling wedge pattern you see highlighted in blue. 

With a confirmed rejection of the daily 20ema without ever looking back and presumably the daily 8ema crossing under the daily 20ema tomorrow this is setting up for a bigger bearish drop. 

Bears have upside to 4045 to still holding falling wedge resistance tomorrow. And the falling wedge support will sit at 3990 tomorrow. 

Major downside target would be 3920 support area (similar to that 390 SPY level) if we continue downside. 

Key Futures Support- 4010 -> 3985 -> 3965

Key Futures Resistance- 4032 -> 4055

&#x200B;

Taking a look at tesla here (and honestly this goes for the majority of Semis/ tech right now) we are seeing a clear rejection and breakout. 

For Tesla specifically we rejected the daily 200ema last week 3 separate times and despite its best efforts Friday and today was not able to get back there. With Thursday bouncing off the daily 8ema support, Friday closing over daily 8ema and now tesla closing back under daily 8ema support today we should naturally look for a bigger sell off to the daily 20ema. 

There is a bigger breakout triangle formed here on Tesla also. The daily bull channel has been broken as of last week so now our most viable pattern is this break out triangle. Support sits at 197 support tomorrow and resistance at 205. Essentially if Tesla opens or pushes red at all tomorrow we will confirm this breakout/ down triangle pattern and that will lead to further downside. However, if it manages to find support tomorrow and retakes 205 this could be a fake breakdown before a breakout back to that daily 200ema at 215. 

Key Tesla Support- 197 -> 191.9 -> 183.7 -> 181.5  
 Key Tesla Resistance- 205 -> 214.3

&#x200B;

Taking a look at the VIX here we had that massive breakout of its breakout triangle‚Ä¶ with a breakout here and a break down on SPY that could be further confirmation of more downside to come on SPY/ VIX. 

Oddly enough we are nearing that key pivot level on the VIX of 23.6. This is like the soft danger zone‚Ä¶ when and if the vix crosses and holds over that level then we will see further downside on SPY and the market as a whole. 

After seeing the VIX relatively flat for the last basically 2 months straight the VIX has had an incredible 28.2% rally from Thursdays low to today HOD. 28.2% in 3 days is pretty incredible. And honestly its more incredible that SPY has only put in one -2% day during that whole time period. 

Actually its pretty incredible that through all of last week with CPI, and PPI that we on a random Tuesday get a -1% red day and the biggest/ worst red day of the year yet‚Ä¶ seems a little interesting to me.

I swang futures calls this weekend and honestly I never looking at the VIX and spy on Friday would have suspected that we would close a -2% red day‚Ä¶ at all. I would take that swing again and again. However, futures showed quite a bit of weakness throughout the weekend but oddly everytime it was looking ready to breakout it just kept getting slapped down over the holiday trading hours. But open it was so far gone that I was hoping for a small relief rally at open to mitigate some loss but PMI took us straight down and it was all over from there. 

After that honestly intraday trading today was not that bad. However, I would have been better off if I stopped trading at 12pm after my 6 wins a row (had a nice intraday streak of 14 wins in a row going). However, that 1245am reversal I had entered a put and fully expected a relief rally up to the 15min 20ema so mitigated my loss (so I thought) I then bit the call bullet thinking when we closed over 8ema that we would continue to breakout, however, we immediately double topped and I shoulda just stuck to my original thesis. 

Looking back I should have trusted VOLD more during that time period and while I was fighting trend slightly a relief rally is expected most days to the 20ema and the fact that we didn‚Äôt get that actually is even more impressive of a red day today. 

Overall not a bad day IV was also elevated today because of FOMC minutes tomorrow which did make the payout for options less than desirable after the bigger morning pushes.",DaddyDersch,108,1677015274.0

$VORB Virgin Orbit is another failing rocket company, they likely won't go bankrupt as they got Richard Branson pumping in money, however they still don't have a rocket that works and multiple failed attempts. No Revenue, no contracts,

So for public companies $RKLB is the clear choice

Relatively Space and Firefly are two other private companies that could benefit, However they are miles behind Rocketlab. Like its their struggling to reach orbit (Firefly hit orbit once, and Relatively Space hasn't even reached orbit lol) Meanwhile Rocketlab goes to orbit every month (sometimes twice a month) with pretty much 100% mission success (a few fuck ups years ago when they were a startup, however SpaceX had the same)

Rocketlab is absolutely fucking shitting on these companies currently, while the others are struggling to not go bankrupt and actually get a working rocket, Rocketlab is past that stage and expanding to compete more with SpaceX

Even the DOD and USA government knows this and is paying Rocketlab with grants to develop their newer rockets ([https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-wins-24m-u-s-space-force-contract-to-develop-neutron-upper-stage/](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-wins-24m-u-s-space-force-contract-to-develop-neutron-upper-stage/))

Blue origin realistically will benefit from this, while they haven't had as much success as Rocketlab, they have a fuck ton of money (Jeff Bezos is ceo) and they skipped all the early development stages and are working on a fucking massive rocket with lots of employees. They also have a sub orbital rocket, so they have proved they can at least make a somewhat proven rocket

Thats why I think blue origin will survive.

Anyways for all those long term holders wanting to find the next $TSLA, starting in 2025 $RKLB and Blue origin will be getting billions in launch contracts only available to them imo as the other non SpaceX and ULA launch companies are getting fucking obbliterited right now by either Rocketlab (taking their launch contracts) or money as building a rocket is hard and expensive, and non of them have been able to do so other than Rocketlab

Overall the minutes honestly outside of the fact that a few members wanted a 50bps (which we knew) the minutes were as expected slightly dovish‚Ä¶ however, this meeting if you remember is prior to strong jobs numbers, PPI and CPI numbers. I do think we are setting up for a more hawkish tone come next FOMC‚Ä¶ depending on what march CPI brings‚Ä¶ biggest takes for me is that some members would have voted for 50bps and the tight job market could cause higher and prolonged inflation‚Ä¶

Taking a look at SPY daily here we have so far quite the bearish movement. We have a really nice 4 day long blue bear channel that is very tight and very dramatic right now. One interesting thing to note is that the overall falling wedge that we were in support broke today. Which means we should be looking for a bigger down trend and a bigger bear channel instead of falling wedge. As you can see the potential red bear channel I have here support was even broke today so for now we are trying to establish where this is actually going to go. 

The most important things to note from today is that this is the 4th red day in a row and not only that we attempted ot breakout back over the daily 50/200ema and rejected that. However, we did not quite break through the daily 100ema support at 396.6. As I mentioned before current movement would suggest 390 support retest is inbound. 

Key SPY Support- 398.5 -> 396.6 -> 395.9 -> 394.4 

Key SPY Resistance- 401 -> 403.1 -> 405.3

Same story here on futures we have a very intense black bear channel for 5 days now‚Ä¶ and we are looking for futures to close right on the 4000 level right now. 

Futures DID test 100ema here however bounced off of it but more importantly it rejected a breakout back over the daily 50/200ema. We also officially have a 8/ 20ema bearish crossover here too. 

Futures key support- 4000 -> 3985 -> 3965 -> 3945

Futures Key Resistance- 4030 -> 4055

Tesla announced today that its engineering HQ would be in California‚Ä¶ short and sweet to the point announcement. 

The biggest thing to note here is that black breakout/ down triangle was officially broke to the downside today. Tesla also attempted to break through and close back over its daily 8ema however was unable to do so. 

Tesla did find a really nice support bounce off that 191.8 support area though. 

Key Tesla Support- 197.4 -> 191.8 -> 183.5

Key Tesla Resistance- 200.8 -> 205 -> 209.2

The VIX honestly is one of the most intriguing things of the day‚Ä¶ historically speaking the VIX generally has pretty significant sell offs post FOMC minutes as the ‚Äúfear‚Äù leaves the market and there is very little left to fear‚Ä¶ however, today we actually saw the VIX drop slightly and then recover and hold its own. I am interested by the fact that the VIX perfectly touched and rejected 23.6 resistance however did not break yesterdays LOD. The VIX appears for the time being that it has more room to go. 

Tonight afterhours/ tomorrow pre market with nvidia, jobs and GDP is a really big day that I am very curious to see how markets will react/ open. Long term I still expect 390 before 405‚Ä¶ however, a relief bounce back to 400 would be warranted.

Actually taking a quick look here at Nvidia earnings their revenue beats might be one of the better earnings reports I have seen all earnings season. That is a fairly impressive report. Nvidia is now testing on the weekly time frame that 215.6 to 230.9 levels.. it has seen two massive rejections up in this level so it will be quite interesting to see what Nvidia does not only tomorrow but Friday.

Overall had a pretty great trading day today.. had some 30-60dte puts that I did close today for some nice wins but also had a few l2l plays intraday. 

Today was tough to trade because we ended up having such aggressive and wild moves price action wise and premium wise it was very difficult to get into some plays‚Ä¶ I probably missed at least 6 plays today that woulda been easy 5-10% wins simply because premiums moved so fast I never got filled and by that time it was chasing. No complaints from today for a fed day with elevated IV. 

I remain bearish till we either break back through 405 OR we reach 390‚Ä¶ we are currently closed to 390 but I don‚Äôt suspect we will reach either by Friday EOD.",DaddyDersch,106,1677105802.0
117y2n6,My Ski Trip with Alexander Karp,"When PLTR was $11 I bought a shit ton of shares. I eventually got a letter in the mail handwritten by Karp. He wanted to thank me for being such a prolific believer in the company, and offered to take me out to Aspen to ski with him. 

The whole ski lift ride he's telling me about WW3, and how Palantir is going to be the only company to come out of the ashes. He went on about data, and it's role in organizing societies once we all revert to using precious metals again. I didn't hit the lift exit right, and he chucked a gold bar at me and called me regarded. Said I'd need it to pay for ski lessons or else the feral dogs would get me in the apocalypse. Like any good bagholder I shook off the warnings signs and just kept on going.

I expressed my disbelief about the whole thing, and he got really offended. Said now that Palantir is profitable he didn't need people like me, or my negativity. The stock had just hit $10, and I could tell he was on one. When I tried to bring up SBC, he challenged me to an 80s ski off. Dude did a double back flip off a jump and ended up winning. Last time I saw Karp he was helping my wife on the bunny slope, and I haven't seen her since. 

That was last week, and I still haven't heard from her. I'll occasionally get emails from Karp about how now that China has balloons Palantir is more needed then ever. He invited me over to Peter Thiel's house for a LOTR marathon, but I'm gonna sit that one out. 

I haven't taken him up on the ski lessons suggestion. I think I'll just take this gold bar and put the money in an index fund.",RetardedStockTrader,107,1676966585.0
112gvjv,CPI DAY! IS 405 or 420 coming next? 2-14-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,"Well today was CPI day and much like January today was a pretty big nothingburger‚Ä¶. We had a pretty large rejection premarket near that 417 area and then saw a large sell off only to recover intraday. Today ended up being nothing but a range day with really not overall direction. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lc2wzdjt38ia1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a88016d6cd6a3970f2d696e5bd33cacf1806dd5

Looking at my predictions I was pretty spot on for CPI and the results. Not too bad! 

When we look at CPI YoY this is the smallest drop from the previous month since the October to November reading which was unchanged. 

CPI MoM this is the biggest increase of 0.4% from the previous month since June to July which went up 0.7% from the previous. 

CORE YoY only dropped by 0.1% from the previous month also the lowest drop since October to November which was a 0.3% increase. 

CORE MoM was unchanged which is similar to what happened from December to January. 

Now when we look at this at face value‚Ä¶ honestly this is not that bullish of a print and this really doesn‚Äôt send that narrative of ‚Äúinflation has peaked and will go straight to 2%‚Äù home nor should it really support the idea that the feds are going to stop rate hikes any time soon‚Ä¶ I think initially markets did react to that if you watched the 830am move you saw it start to drop at first. However the bulls once again took over‚Ä¶ So now the question remains whats next? 

&#x200B;

Looking at the SPY daily chart here honestly there are a ton of different ways that this can go‚Ä¶ 

On one hand we have clearly since the last week of December been making higher highs. However, on the other hand we have also now entered consolidation finally. 

If you look at this objectively since the peak on February 2nd we have not seen a new high.. so we are now at 8 trading days of failing to make a new high. 

However, another way to look at this also is that since SPY took 405.3 resistance on February 1st we have actually be in a now 9 days consolidation from 405 to 417 area. 

We have twice now broken the bull channel support line, however, each time the bulls have managed to find support against and push higher. 

Today we are looking at another failed breakout and also a failed break down. We ended with a nice doji candle. However, we did manage to close over the daily 8ema again. 

There are some bullish indicators to look at here such as the fact we did close over the daily 8ema and failed to close a new low. However, on a bearish standpoint you can see that we got hard rejected at 415 today on the breakout. 

Now the question here is 420 or 405 first? Well we have been trying for pretty much 8 days now to get the momentum needed to reach 420 and we just seem to fail every single time. 

Tomorrow we will see how markets actually digest the data from today and what the fed speakers said today. 

Key SPY support- 411.2 -> 408.5 -> 405.3 -> 402.9 -> 400.7

Key SPY Resistance- 413 -> 414.4 -> 416.8 -> 419.5

Taking a look at futures here we see a very similar movement here and a very similar idea. Overall we are just stuck and cant seem to push over that 4210 top from February 1st. We have shown far more weakness on futures in my opinion breaking under 4095 on 3 different days now in the last 2 weeks of trading. 

However, bulls continue to make this a buy the dip situation. 

Currently I have 2 major levels I am watching on Futures that is 4095 and 4178. 

Key Futures Support- 4122 -> 4095 -> 4085 -> 4040

Key Futures Resistance- 4150 -> 4178 -> 4210

Tesla continues to rip and run like we are back in the 2020/2021 bull market‚Ä¶

Most incredibly Tesla only putting in about 110% of its daily volume managed to put in a 167% average 10 day range. Not only that but IV only priced in about an $8 move for today and it nearly tripled that move. 

Tesla looks like it is absolutely going to retest that daily 200ema resistance back at 215 tomorrow or last this week. 

Now the one interesting thing here is that besides once again Tesla and Nvidia tech as a whole today looked extremely weak and did now show much strength. We are still watching some of the speculative and really AI bubble stocks rally while the majority of tech remains neutral to slightly bullish. 

As long as some of tech is rallying like this it is really hard to justify SPY having any major correction‚Ä¶ however, the long and higher speculative tech rallies the bigger the correction later on for them. 

Key Tesla Support- 202.2 -> 196.8 -> 191.8 -> 183.7 -> 181.6

The VIX was more volatile today than I have seen it be in a very long time. We saw the VIX open near that 19.4 mark area (when market opened I mean) and then from there It rallied pretty hard back to 20. From there we saw the VIX take another dump down to that 19 area with that huge $6 morning rally SPY had. After that we saw the VIX dump once again and from there the VIX just saw near that 18.5 to 19 level for most of the day. 

This was a very aggressive sell off/ correction on the VIX today. I am curious to see if we get any sort of rebound on the VIX tomorrow. We are back in that 18.3 to 19.3 bounce area on the VIX. 

**Daily log-**

Well as I called out I suspect that calls would not be the play today and I suspected that the best risk to reward lied with puts not calls. 

I did swing some puts that I actually am incredibly shocked weren‚Äôt -100% at open. I attempted to get a fill around -30% on that huge morning dump but unfortunately got a shit fill around -48%. 

&#x200B;

Intraday trading today was fairly successful though. Profitable day trading but obviously red on the day. 

I got burnt on a call during that massive morning reversal. I also stopped myself out of puts twice only for it to go profitable later on (I cut them due to it breaking key levels for me and expecting a breakout) and I also was in a put when we were holding that mid day 411 resistance and looking primed for a reversal. However, a fed speaker decided to say ‚Äúwe are very close to the end‚Äù when referring to rate hikes and sent the markets absolutely ripping only for them to complete walk back that statement later. 

Honestly, day trade wise today I am very satisfied with my trading. Yes I would have preferred a huge red day but I stuck to my rules and was able to get some nice wins in and some nice plays. These CPI days are always extremely volatile and hard to trade and honestly most CPI days I don‚Äôt even trade as much as I did today. 

Will be looking forward to seeing how the rest of the week shakes out here.

Just caught this tweet EOD‚Ä¶ if its coming from NICK its very important‚Ä¶ markets do not have this priced in‚Ä¶",DaddyDersch,107,1676410626.0
11o3ffw,"Is this are black swan event? All eyes on CPI next week‚Ä¶ 3-10-23 SPY/ ES Futures, VIX, DXY and 10YR Yield Weekly Market Recap and Analysis","The question everyone wants to know the answer to is ‚Äúwas this a one off even with SVIB or is there contagion and this going to be a true market wide run on banks?‚Äù

The answer is know one knows for sure. I don‚Äôt know if going into a weekend right now is better or worse for this sort of situation. This has the potential to be the black swan event that puts SPY at not only a 52 week low but could easily cause a true market crash. However, if this is just a one off event and this gets ironed out quickly and in a timely fashion this actually could end up being okay. 

We are either watching before our eyes the start of the next market crash or we are watching yet again markets barely survive ‚Äúthe big one.‚Äù Only time will tell for sure‚Ä¶ 

Honestly at this point unless that‚Äôs your round house or you are directly effect in a work setting the best thing anyone can do is continue to preserve capital and continue to make smart financial decisions. We despite what happens here are still likely to have an extremely bumpy 2023 and probably 2024. Remember the FED hasn‚Äôt even pivoted yet and generally post pivot is when the actual bottom is put in‚Ä¶ so this could continue to be a rogue year or two. 

Also just because we saw some probably once in a life time 1million % gainers on SVIB the last few days does not mean that is the normal. Do not go chasing these types of crash winners‚Ä¶ Even myself today let my winners run more than I usually do and I did it in a slightly more carefree way due to the environment. We 100% can prosper from this situation but stay humble and most importantly stay smart!

**CPI**

Next week is CPI‚Ä¶ why does that matter? Well this is going to be probably one of the most important CPI readings we have had in a very long time.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7xigkz7iqzma1.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=20eccf3af518e28ad1be5dea8ba353b8832ddf4c

Now what actually is somewhat impressive and reassuring here is that the chances for a 50bps hike has now gone from almost 80% before the 830am data to now 38% chances here at market close. 

CPI is going to be extremely important as it is the last major data that we will get (we do get PPI the next day) before FOMC on the 22nd. IF we get a good CPI reading then there is a very good chance that markets are going to fully price in a 25bps hike (there could depending on this bank situation even be a case for 0bps crazy enough). However, IF CPI comes in hot (a true rebound) then we are going to go to 100% chance 50bps and with his already scare market because of the bank situation we are going to see a repeat of June CPI if not worse‚Ä¶ 

My thoughts are this‚Ä¶ if CPI is good this is going to take a lot of fear out of the market not only for inflation but for rate hikes. Not only that but these market algos are looking for any reason to rally us. 

With the VIX nearly breaking 30 today and SPY now back in the 380s this is set up for a massive move one way or the other. My thoughts are here that if this banking situation is calmed by Tuesday and we get a good CPI we are going to see a pretty incredible rally into FOMC on the 22nd. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Currently SPY is at 188million volume this would make today the highest volume day on SPY since February 24th which was 214 million total volume. Interesting enough that was a major bounce point‚Ä¶ 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mklcuwoiqzma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=204a0c709456dd6bcc57297aac0d4796189def00

Taking a look at the daily supply/ demand chart here we have that newly established 405.17 supply (resistance). We are pretty much set up here (and this will likely depend on the bank issue/ CPI) for an even bigger breakdown to the 373.98/ 376.67 demand (support) from November/ December or we are set up to establish a new demand (support) potential on that 383.8 supply and make a pretty impressive push back to 388.52 and 394.68 demands (previous support now turned into resistance). 

We fell just short of 383.82 supply (support), however, there is a chance on Monday we could very well go down and touch that level. 

**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/inpyr45jqzma1.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e591feff17927ba90f9fae0f6e466c30d6f7d043

Honestly looking at the weekly S/D chart here it seems fairly obvious now that since really November we have just been chopping in this broad 382.2 to 412.5 channel. We are now coming in once again on this 382.2 demand (support). 

The fear here for bulls would be either this bank situation or CPI breaks us not only under 382.2 but closes us under it. IF that were to happen there is a very good chance depending on what FOMC would bring the following week that we could see a very impressive sell off down to 357.3. That 382.2 demand (support) is going to be a major level to watch. 

However, if we were to have a bullish week next week there is a very big chance that we could establish a higher demand (support) above that 382.2 level which would be bullish and I would 100% without a doubt start looking for a bigger recovery and push back to the 400s. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nofdbynjqzma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e1d64cf4b79fb0940a41c5a0591de31f7834dae4

Taking a look at the spy daily here you can see we are in a pretty obvious massive blue falling wedge here. With this finally closing a candle below 390.1 the natural assumption would be for this to continue to breakdown to that 378 channel support. At this point we have gone from the November 395 to 405 consolidation channel to now attempting to break back down into the December 375 to 385 consolidation channel. 

SPY has officially fallen 5.7% or about $24 dollars in 4 trading days and has falling 4.3% or about $17 in the last two trading days. 

This much like that massive $12 breakout we had last week is overdue for a correction back to the upside. Now the caveat here versus that rally is that this is data/ news driven and this could turn into a bigger continuation. This was not a rogue fed speaker mentioning something to cause a rally. This is a really big deal. 

My thoughts here is that going into CPI Tuesday (granted this depends on nothing new happening with the banks over the weekend) that Monday is going to be a consolidation day. WE are very likely to see a smaller range type of day. We could easily attempt to recover back to the 390 area or we could attempt to get back down to the 380 area before EOD. I would not expect this extent of sell off to continue on Monday. However, if we continue to see sell offs like this into next week then that‚Äôs when we know this isn‚Äôt going to be just a one of bank and the true panic will set in‚Ä¶ 

Bulls ultimate target will be to retrace 390 and breakout back to 400/405 on a good CPI.

Bears ultimate target is to break under key 378 support and make a run for the 360s with a hot CPI reading. 

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sseco35kqzma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6f64c6782580c24c0c8235551456a8a866c1db2b

The bulls biggest concern here is that we have officially lost the key pivot point of 390.1 With the bears finally closing under this support level that is very worrisome for anyone who wishes to go long here‚Ä¶ I will say that 390.1 is probably for the last 10 months been the most important single price level on SPY. 

Something I have talked about before but since May of 2022 until present day SPY has spent an extreme amount of time trading in the 375 to 407 range on the weekly. Of the last 44 weeks of trading‚Ä¶ all but 5 weeks has had price action that has taken place between 375 and 407‚Ä¶ that means that 88.6% of the last 44 weeks has at some point traded within the same $32 range‚Ä¶ 

Of the last 44 weeks all but 13 weeks have CLOSED within that same $32 range‚Ä¶ that means of the last 44 weeks of trading 70.5% of the time the market has closed within the same $32 range. 

I think much like I said back in 2022 this is where the majority of our trading for 2023 and possibly 2024 will take place. 

The issue we face here is that we have to ask the question‚Ä¶ are we more likely to see 375 or 407 again? There is obviously a case to be made for both. IF you are a bear here is your perfect opportunity to take a 30-60dte put and look for 375 if not the 360s. However, if you are generally bullish now is your time for 30-60dte calls and I would look for a retest of 407.

Bulls ultimately want to see a close over minimally 396.3 next week and bears ultimately want a close under 375.6. 

SPY Weekly Levels:

Support- 382.2 -> 375.7 -> 367.9  
 Resistance- 390.1 -> 396.3 -> 403.2

Supply- 383.82 -> 405.17  
 Demand- 373.98 -> 376.67 -> 388.52 -> 394.68

NOTE- this is going to be frustrating for the new week or two while the contracts roll on futures‚Ä¶ on tradingview they already rolled, however, TOS did not roll. I will try and talk old and new contracts to avoid confusion. In general S/D will be off old contracts and price action will be new contracts. 

Today we early morning looking like we were going to attempt to hold the 3920 demand (support) and turn that into a double bottom. However as you can see that did not work out too well for the bulls. 

We after establishing that 4055 supply (resistance) have really not looked back. We were able to break through 3960 and now 3920 demand (supports). These levels will now become resistance if we attempt to breakout next week. 

On a down side here we only have 3833 demand (support) established. If we were to lose that level and not immediately establish a new demand (support) then we do not really have anything holding us up until we get to that 3683 demand (support). 

However, if the bulls can quickly establish a new demand or reconfirm 3833 demand (support) Monday and we get a good CPI on Tuesday then I would look for a breakout to the 3960 to 4055 area. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

Now what is most impressive here on the futures weekly (remember old contract) is that we are actually attempting to close exactly on 3864 demand (support). That actually could end up much like when we bounced and closed two weeks ago on 3971 demand (support) which led to a really nice double bottom. However, this time it then immediately led to a double top and established a new supply (resistance) at 4055. 

With the bulls holding over this key level that dates back to the December lows we have found ourselves at a high potential bounce point. However, if we were to lose 3865 next week I would start looking for that previous 3600 demand (support). 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

Now keep in mind here contracts rolled on ES for tradingview last night so these candles are going to be a little off and you will see that levels are off‚Ä¶ these will over the next week normalize and basically once we establish a new low and a new high it all fixes itself‚Ä¶

However, what you see is this bigger and broader red bear channel and we have a falling blue wedge being established within that. 

We did lose 3920 pivot point and now that would open up a breakdown to previous 3810 support. However, if the bulls can quickly take back 3920 next week this could look for a recovery back to the 4000-4050 area. 

Again so much depends on not only the banks but on CPI next week. I actually wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a very large either red or green week next week at all.

I have talked about this before but the JPM collar‚Ä¶ I mentioned on week 7 that historically that is the top or bottom and from week 7 to week 11 we see a reversion to mean‚Ä¶ which actually is playing out beyond perfectly right now. 

IF that pattern pays out we very well could start the next move up next week. As you can see here though with losing that key 3920 pivot point we now find ourselves staring down 3860 support. That will be a major level to watch.

Bears ultimate target will be a closure under 3860 support which opens up a breakdown to 3770 support. However, bulls ultimate target will be a closure minimally back over 3975. That would open up the potential for a move back to 4000s. 

Futures Weekly Levels

Supply (old)- 4055 -> 4150  
 Demand (old)- 3600 -> 3865 -> 3970

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0twlwbkmqzma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9d2f6371571b4d369bae7cff26dd4b41f5c07226

The VIX had an incredible day. I do not know the last time I have seen the VIX swing in price action the way it did today.. Amazingly the VIX still did not break through 30 today‚Ä¶ however it did reach its highest level since October 25th. AT that time SPY was trading from 378 to 385 so that is actually pretty on par for the course. 

Now the question is based on VIX here is are markets risk off or risk on? IS there fear or is there not fear? 

We actually have reached the extreme fear level of 24 today for the first time since October 13th. You what is incredibly magical about October 13th? Well that was the 52 week low on SPY‚Ä¶ that was the day that led to an incredible bounce from the 340s to the 420s. 

When I look at this I honestly think to myself that with extreme fear already set in and the VIX already elevated that unless this unwinds in an incredible way Monday that CPI is once again setting us up for one heck of a green rally. 

IF that CPI (which so far looks like it will per my estimates) puts in a lower YoY and MoM (shows that CPI is still dropping) then there is a really good chance that this market is going to put in an incredibly green day. I don‚Äôt know if will be as wild as Novembers 5.5% green day but I think we could easily see a 3-4% green day‚Ä¶ 

**DXY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rh7w2y3nqzma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fa2e9b1cbbf03dc5880b0c99d7c83ad32eb466ff

It was very clear today that the trust in the dollar fell which makes sense to see it drop like it did today. However, by EOD it did recover almost all of is losses. TO me that shows the strength in the dollar and I think that paints a bigger picture of this being a one off event as of now‚Ä¶ 

With DXY also breaking its rising wedge this further goes with my expectations of a massive green week next week. 

**10YR YIELD**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9r672uinqzma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=828900419b08e1c69bbb1cc333e33f751b27317a

Yields as a whole today had a massive drop across the boards. Now granted I am still 100% a rookie when it comes to yields and I am learning here so correct me if I am wrong here guys! 

But with this massive drop in rates today on the 10yr (and really market wide) while SPY sold off that shows that money is running to the safe haven of the yields. Money is 100% scared right now and the broader market is scared that this could be the next major financial crisis. 

This here also sets us up (SPY) for a massive green week next week. Why well when the yields sell off the way they have here (meaning money came out of market/ risk) when CPI comes in cooler next week and the chances of a 50bps go to 0% and we even start talking about a 0bps hike we are going to see all of this scared money flow right back into the markets. That is going to cause an incredible rally next week. 

This rally is support by the way DXY is moving also.

Today was probably my single best day I have had in 6-9months (not including lottos). This is my first perfect day (100% win rate) since February 22nd. 

Honestly today with the incredibly high volume and volatility actually felt like trading in a bull market again. All we had to do was be patient and wait for our play. Yes there was some rouge candles (mostly EOD) but almost everything from a technical stand point played out perfectly. Why is that? Well because there was BIG money in this today‚Ä¶ when big money and big volume come in they are all trading by computers/ algos.

What have I said since the beginning? My job as a trader is to figure out what those algos are going to do next and capitalize on it. Of course we never look to get the full move and we know we are only getting the bread crumbs from the bigger piece of the pie‚Ä¶ but today we absolutely killed it. 

Honestly today reminded me (which I haven‚Äôt felt in a long time) about how fun and easy it is trading during a bull market. I have preached for this whole bear market that the number one goal is capital preservation so that when we finally see the next bull market (and really just not a market with low volume/ easily manipulated by large orders) that we can fully reap the reward. 

I told myself (as hard as it was) last week that I would not do any more swings this week. I strictly day traded and despite being 100% correct on every swing I would have taken this week‚Ä¶ I am extremely happy with this week and I am extremely happy going into the weekend!

11hh7v9,Are the bulls back in control?... 3-3-23 SPY/ ES Futures Weekly Market Analysis,"I have still had a lot of questions about supply and demand. I have had some complaints that people don‚Äôt want me to include supply and demand anymore because its confusing. However, I think its extremely important and I will explain why I cant always interchange supply/ demand with resistance/ support. While at times they are interchangeable these levels hold a different type of weight compared to just my standard price action levels. I am going to include the below excerpt in my TA for a while to hopefully have a reference for people to look back to. If you understand supply/ demand or have read the below then skip to the first chart picture. 

**What is supply and demand?**

The law of supply and demand is a theory that seeks to explain the relationship between the availability and desire for a product, such as a security, and its price. Typically, low availability and high demand boost the price of an item and high availability and low demand reduce its price. The law affects the stock market by determining the prices of the individual stocks that make up the market.

**Demand**

At some point, a stock‚Äôs price will drop enough that buyers will find it attractive. There are many factors that can changes this dynamic. As buyers move into the market for a stock, demand grows faster than supply and so the price will increase. This becomes known as a ‚Äúdemand‚Äù area which one could also call a bigger support area. When price finally reaches that point that buyers say ‚Äúthis is too good to pass up‚Äù then enough buyers come in to establish a new support area or ‚Äúdemand.‚Äù

If demand for a stock exceeds the supply, its price will rise. However, it will only rise to the point where buyers find the price attractive.

**Supply**

As you know, declining demand will cause stock owners to sell. As owners sell (for any reason), the price will fall as there is now more supply than demand. By dropping the price, sellers of the stock hope to encourage someone to buy it. This declining demand causes a new level of selling which is referred to as ‚Äúsupply‚Äù and that would also be known as resistance. 

The dynamic works just the same when demand increases but in reverse. As the price falls, it will reach a level where buyers find the stock attractive, and demand will increase. When investors start buying, the stock‚Äôs price will rise as more and more sellers need to be enticed to sell their shares.

Often supply and demand find equilibrium at a price that buyers accept, and sellers accommodate. When supply and demand balance, so they are roughly equal, prices will gyrate up and down in a narrow price range. We can find many examples of stocks staying in a flat range for days or months before an event disrupts the supply/demand balance.

In short, a supply level IS a resistance level and a demand level IS a support level. However, a resistance level is not always a supply level and a support level is now always a demand level. Why is that? Well because if you take a look at my daily chart we have the black solid horizontal lines (the ones that have always been there‚Ä¶. Plus the color coordinated channels). As you know these support/ resistance lines are established based on daily price action. 

What I do to find my channels is then find an area of price action support/ resistance that time and time again. While one could say these pockets or levels of heavy price action support/ resistance are a supply/ demand zone and sometimes like at 405.8 currently they do match‚Ä¶ they are not always an indicator based supply/ demand zone. 

**How do we trade supply/ demand?**

Now the most important question is this‚Ä¶ how do we trade supply and demand? Well this one is just like how we have always traded our support/ resistance. Lets take the current down trend we are in. In order to bounce what do we need? We need a bounce. We need to reach a support level that is so good that people say fine I will buy back in. Now what is a level that someone finally says lets buy back in? Yes exactly! It‚Äôs a Demand! So we can not establish a ‚Äúbottom‚Äù or ‚Äúbounce‚Äù until a new demand is established. 

So take yesterday we established a new 394.6 demand level and now we are bouncing off that demand level. 

What happens once a new demand (inverse this for support) level is established? The natural flow (assuming we are not in extreme momentum) is that a new demand is established and then price will naturally move up to take out the previous demand. This is moving from support to a previously established support. 

For example. Yesterday we established 394.6 as demand‚Ä¶ assuming we are not in extreme bear momentum‚Ä¶ we would then expect a push back to 400.6 which is the previous demand from 2/23. In general if price action fails to reach that level then we should expect it to come back down to the previous demand of 394.6. However, if price action is able to breach that previous demand level then we ‚Äútake it off the books.‚Äù 

In theory and in general you want to establish higher and higher demands as price is rising. This would be ‚Äúsupporting‚Äù the price action. Same thing in theory when we are coming down. As we drop you want to see the price flow down‚Ä¶ up‚Ä¶ down‚Ä¶ up‚Ä¶ as it is doing this we will establish new supply levels throughout the drop. 

In general supply should always be over demand. IF a supply is established below a demand then that is obviously bearish in nature. IF price action moves up and establishes a new supply without taking out a lower previous supply then one could assume that area will be retested at some point or this would be a ‚Äútarget‚Äù on a bigger sell off. Price action in general does not like to see areas left like that. However, from a demand stand point it is okay to leave previous demands down below. Why? Well because naturally there are more buyers than sellers in the stock market and in general a new demand (support) has to be established in order for price to go up. 

**Summary of supply/ demand**

Supply= resistance. Demand= support. Price moves from Demand (support) to previous supply (resistance). 

Markets flow up and down (support to resistance or demand to supply). In general an area of price action also marked by a supply or demand is a major level to watch. 

Market theory does not want to leave a supply below a demand. However, in order for markets to continue their natural movement up (remember stocks generally speaking go up over time) you need to establish new demands along the way up. 

Let me know if you guys have any questions on this and I will add more details as requested.

Despite correctly calling in pre-market analysis that the ultimate bull target was 400.7 and extreme was 403‚Ä¶ I honestly am shocked we were able to get there today. The bulls 100% impressed me and stumped me a little today. We came within 2 pts of that 4055 target today‚Ä¶. Just an absolutely extreme momentum bear two day bull trend.

So by that nature IF we see that average move we could see SPY settle somewhere around 411.06 to 397.3 on Friday at market close.

Taking a look at the supply and demand chart we are setting up a similar scenario that I was mentioned in the overnight TA‚Ä¶ which was a massive push to 400.7 to take that demand out (which I will remove from the chart after today now) and we will either continue at this point to take out 405.74 demand from 1/30 and continue our push up. Or we are going to potentially establish a new supply (preferably after we take out 405.7 demand). 

IF we establish a supply short of the previous 414-417 supply area then that would be a good short opportunity. However, I would not retake a short on this until we put a new supply in at this point. 

Best bear case for supply/ demand- continue push to take out 405.74 demand -> establish new supply short of previous 414 -> retrace back to previous supply of 396.5 to take that out. 

Best bull case for supply/ demand- continue push to take out 405.74 -> continue push to 414 and reconfirm that as supply. (extreme bull case would be a push straight to 417 (over time) and then turn 414 supply into demand).

Its funny that a lot of people were saying my levels didn‚Äôt make sense and I was saying that showed just how imbalanced this market really was. This move up here finally is giving us an opportunity to balance stuff.

Weekly supply/ demand wise not a whole lot going on but it should be note that we do have an area here where we could establish a new demand around this 400 area. 

Weekly supply (upside resistance)- 412.53 -> 427.5 

Weekly demand (downside support)- 382.2 -> 357.3

&#x200B;

Now at some point this daily chart HAS to retrace. There is just too many ‚Äúgaps‚Äù in price action down below to now have a meaningful pullback at some point. However, this daily chart looks hella bullish to me and I expect a 405 retest next week. If we can close over that then we could attempt to break back into that 405 to 415 channel leading into CPI on the 14th. 

Bull case- come back down to retest 20ema support -> break through and CLOSE daily candle over 405.3 -> break back into 405 to 415 channel. 

Bear case- hard rejection (no CLOSE) over 405.3 -> come back down and lose daily 20/ 8ema support -> lose key 400 support of the daily 50/200ema. 

&#x200B;

On a weekly time frame one almost could say this was a MASSIVE bull flag‚Ä¶ not only did we break down and retest weekly 20ema and 8ema support we actually close over those levels and closed over last weeks resistance. This weekly chart looks extremely bullish and is set up for a push back to minimally 407.7 area if this momentum continues. 

From a breakout triangle stand point here we have support at 394.9 and resistance at 409.5 (which is right below previous supply at 410.1). 

Bulls really need to take out 407.7 resistance and have an upside push and close over 412.2. However, bears would really like to see this close minimally back under 396.4 next week. 

Weekly supply (upside resistance)- 412.53 -> 427.5 

Weekly demand (downside support)- 382.2 -> 357.3

Weekly SPY Support- 403.2 -> 396.4 -> 390.1

Weekly SPY Resistance- 407.3 -> 412.4 -> 417.2

Taking a look at the supply/ demand here on futures you can see that beautiful double bottom of 3960 demand (support) which then led to a push back to where we close today. I am actually a little surprised that 4015/4020 supply area didn‚Äôt put up more of a fight than it did. Honestly I am really shocked that futures rallied from 3925 to HOD of 4053 today. That 3.26% from low to high in two trading days (on futures). That‚Äôs one hell of a pump! 

The only upside target here (demand wise) would be 4096. That level correlated with a 1% move up or about 408 on SPY. 

Now of course we have that bigger supply up at 4160 (resistance ) we could target but that‚Äôs a massive move and would be a future target IF momentum continues up. 

Bullish supply/ demand case- establish this 4050-4060 area as supply Monday -> retrace to 3990 and take out both of those supplies -> establish new demand at 3990 (turn previous resistance into support) -> then start a push up again

Bearish supply/ demand case- establish a supply here -> push back to 3990 -> lose 3990 and retrace back below previous 3960 demand (lose previous support). 

&#x200B;

Now interestingly enough on the weekly supply/ demand chart and this is exactly why I trade spy but watch SPY/ futures‚Ä¶ we just established a new weekly demand at 3970. This means that this sell off here actually put in a higher demand (support) than the previous sell off had. That is VERY bullish and actually signals this as a local bottom. 

Bullish weekly supply/ demand case- use this 3970 demand (support) establishment to push to 4148 supply (resistance) and attempt to turn the 4148 supply (resistance) into demand (support). 

Bearish weekly supply/ demand case- either retest 4148 supply and confirm it as supply (resistance again) and start our descent back to 3970 demand (support) or establish a new supply between 3970 and 4148 and then push back to/ below 3970 demand (support). 

&#x200B;

From a weekly time frame here on futures we have a very similar pattern. While we did not quite officially touch 3920 pivot point we did touch 3925. This was a really nice weekly double bottom and recovery back over the weekly 8, 20, 50 and 100ema. Only thing that woulda been better is a bullish engulfing weekly candle. 

Weekly breakout/ down triangle here gives us support at 3950 and resistance at 4150.

Weekly supply (resistance)- 4148 -> 4284

Weekly demand (support)- 3970-> 39865 

Future Weekly Support- 4020 -> 3920

Futures weekly Resistance- 4075 ->4095 -> 4150

Honestly with the daily bear channels breaking, retaking of major emas and form a weekly double bottom/ new demand being established as very bullish. My ultimate target is 407.7/ 4075 next week. The only caveat here is that this is pre-CPI week and that can be highly unpredictable. However, most of the data I am seeing is fairly bullish and 2. We have a lot of major data end of next week consumer credit (Tuesday) and JPOW 10am for a report to congress -> ADP employment/ JOLTS (Wednesday) -> jobless (Thursday) -> unemployment rate (Friday). 

We have 4 straight days of huge data/ information from the markets and that is going to make for a volatile week.

This week was good and bad. Lets talk about it in two different areas‚Ä¶ swing trades and level to level (intraday day trading). 

From a swing stand point you can see that did not go very well and is for now the 3rd week in a row (if we include the CPI swing lotto) this is why I have closed a red week. **The biggest lesson is no more swings.** My biggest issue with the swings is there is no set and defined stop loss‚Ä¶ well there is but they usually result in these bigger losses which is harder to recoup. The other issue is talking myself into holding them longer. 

When I look at the **swings** I took I opened last Friday an Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and SPY 30dte put. I also had an AMD and Nvidia put from earlier in the week too.

I honestly expect us to have a more dramatic sell off and while we did EVENTUALLY push lower and come close to that 390/3920 area I was targeting the absolutely brutal rangy chop to get there that we had absolutely wrecked the premiums on the way down. 

I was able to close out on Wednesday and Thursday all my 30dte puts. AMD and Nvidia were very red unfortunately. Looking back I would have just closed those post earnings. The frustrating thing is that AMD especially came within breakeven a few times and seemed like at every potential breakdown would get either a sympathy pump from nvidia, the market or that people taking a stake in it and just take me further and further away. 

Lessons I learned from these 30dte puts‚Ä¶ 1. 60dte puts > 30dte puts. 2. I should have waited for AMD/ nvidia till post earnings. 3. Risk to reward is better with going in on a bigger SPY position instead of numerous tickers. 5. Need a clear cut rule on swings that if > -20% regardless of DTE close position. 

Now from a **DAY TRADING** perspective‚Ä¶ I killed it this week! This was my best week of day trading since the week of January 24th. 

This week I used a few new things that really helped me not only cut positions (losers) faster but gave me the confirmation I need to either get in or not get into a position. Win rate wise I did only see about 71.4% win rate, however, because I only let 3 positions go to stop loss (which I moved to -10% this week) and cut most of my losers around -5 to -6% I was able to turn in a much larger and better profit this week. 

Something I used to do is ‚Äúcommit to a play‚Äù but over commit in reality as I was basically saying I have a stop loss set lets let it run until profit or until we hit stop. However, many times I had ‚Äúsigns‚Äù to exit early. While there are times I will 100% stop myself out early on a rogue bounce 99% of the time cutting these losers early is 100% the play. 

For instance moving my stop loss to -10%, cutting losers early and still keeping the same profits I went from an average of about 0.71% (last week), -0.71% (2/13 week) and 0.38% (week of 2/5) per trade (so this is the average % gain (when factoring all trades +/- % by the total number of trades) to an average of 3.21% this week. 

That‚Äôs nearly a 3x gain of profits % / trade. 

I have always said the biggest lessons for me come from red weeks not green weeks. Despite a red week here I am very happy with the results and I am excited for next week. 

From an overall trading perspective January was a KILLER month for me (had been one of my best months in a long long time) and February was absolutely terrible. It‚Äôs a new month and I couldn‚Äôt be excited going forward. 

I closed all my longs today going to start with a clean slate next week and stick mostly to my intraday trading. Im beyond excited for next week.",DaddyDersch,103,1677882758.0

I actually was very surprised to see bulls push it up like they did middle of the day as most technical did not really support a move like that. However, as seen below a perfectly timed tweet seems to have coordinated perfectly with that massive $3.13 sell off. It is not common that we go coast to coast (HOD to LOD) but we sure did today‚Ä¶

Actually the most impressive thing is the fact that the final one minute candle dropped a total of $1.2. 

To me it seemed like markets were starting to forget about the whole 50bps hike thing and CPI being HOT‚Ä¶ However, they were kindly reminded today and that seems to have fueled this sell off here today. 

With markets reminded of 50bps we could see a small continuation sell off tomorrow.

Taking a look at SPY here you can see we have a really nice black bear channel going here. There is also a tighter more aggressive bear channel (red) inside of that. That could very well be a falling wedge. If that is a falling wedge then resistance for bulls to break for an upside push would be 397.4 tomorrow. That level coincidentally enough was MAJOR support almost all day long. 

The biggest things to note here is that tomorrow when markets open the daily 8ema will cross below the daily 50/200ema for the first time in over a month. Not only that but today we attempted ot break over the daily 200ema and couldn‚Äôt even touch it. Despite bouncing off the 100ema most of the day and yesterday we also closed below that. 

I still am eyeing 390 here and hold to that until SPY closes back over 400. We also have an established supply level at 396.42 that we did break back and close under today. This level could turn itself into nice resistance here. We have a large gap on supply back down to 383.81 and upside to 414/415.23. After establishing demand at 400.6 on 2/23 we retested that yesterday and rejected there. We should with that rejection seek on next demand at 388.66 unless we can establish a new demand this week first. 

Supply- 396.42 -> 383.81

Demand- 400.62 -> 388.66

Key SPY Support- 396.3 -> 395.4 -> 393.6 -> 391.44

Key SPY Resistance- 397.3 -> 398.5 -> 400 -> 400.6

Taking a look at ES futures here we actually have an even more bearish looking chart than Spy. I said I was worried that we COULD see a double bottom off that 3975 and that could push us up and that was in the back of my mind. However, bears struck back with another daily 8ema rejection, crossing the daily 8ema below the 50/200ema and closing under the daily 100ema. Now only that but we have a bearish engulfing daily candle here. 

Demand was established at 3975 on Friday which could have provided a bigger push up. However, we were not able to the the momentum up and with extreme bear momentum down the 8ema rejected us nicely here. With a presumable close below 3975 here the next target is 3915 demand. 

However, Supply wise we had a previous level at 4020 and yesterdays candle resistance now becomes new demand at 3988. With a rejection off supply and also losing demand here I am very much so bearish on futures and I am looking for that 3915/3920 area to be touched. I remain bearish as long as futures is under 4020. 

Supply- 3988 -> 4020 

Demand- 3975 -> 3915 

Key Futures Support- 3965 -> 3945 -> 3920

Key Futures Resistance- 3975 -> 3990 -> 4000 -> 4008 -> 4020

Tesla had a surprisingly weak showing today. I would have expected more strength today leading into investor day. However, after establishing a supply zone at 207.7 yesterday it attempted to push back to the previous supply of 214.24 and was unable to. With that failure we should start looking for a push down to demand near 196.3. However, with the tsla event tomorrow after hours this could go either way. 

Supply- 207.7 -> 214.24 -> 224.75

Demand- 196.29 -> 164.18

Key Tesla Support- 205.6 -> 202.1 -> 197.8

Key Tesla Resistance- 210.7 -> 214.2 -> 219.2

Kinda surprisingly here is the fact that the VIX did not spike when we had that massive EOD sell off. It id recoil a little bit eod and bounced off its daily 20ema and closed under its daily 8ema‚Ä¶ but with a sell off of that size I would have expected more bounce there. That could come tomorrow though. One thing I did note that besides Friday the PC ratio is very low this week on Spy.

11301qf,AutoZone: The Crowded Room,"*TLDR;* **Autozone (AZO) is currently valued at $2,500 per share. This is due to its decade-long resistance against splitting its stock. However, its balance sheet sheds light on a company that is hemorrhaging money quickly and has shaky fundamentals at best. In the future, AutoZone may be forced to dilute current shareholders risking a mutiny by its 94% institutional holders. With low liquidity and a high level of institutional investing, any fund that begins to sell out of its position will potentiate a downward spiral. For this reason, I believe that AZO is currently grossly overvalued even at its current EPS and analyst forecasts. AutoZone reports earnings on 02/28 which I believe will lead to AZO's decline in valuation.** 

&#x200B;

The argument can be made that, at any given time a stock is valued precisely as it should be. Every seller must have a buyer willing to pay the quoted price. It is up to the investor's discretion, however, whether or not they are willing to place a similar value on the security being offered. In looking at the stock valuation of Autozone (AZO), I will try to summarize how this principle has led investors to grossly overpay for a company that is most likely hemorrhaging money.



https://preview.redd.it/ctux814zpcia1.png?width=1495&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d771505873c08639162ad327ccaca69380d4528d

Here we have AutoZone's (AZO) stock summary. Ignoring the +36,936% increase in stock valuation since the early '90s, we can see that AZO has maintained a modest amount of shares outstanding for being such a seasoned company. The $2,546 per stock valuation reflects the company's avoidance of performing any stock splits since 1994. Similar to Berkshire Hathaway's strategy, avoiding stock splits allows for a decreased dilution of shares and ultimately more value returned to shareholders per stock held (in theory).

The daily volume of shares exchanged per day is typically low, and it takes fewer shares to move the price of the stock. This strategy also has the added benefit of boosting EPS, as earnings are not spread as thinly across millions of shares. AZO's PE ratio is 21.38, which is moderately high but does not raise too many red flags. Therefore, on the surface, it looks like a solid company with astounding earnings and a flawless track record. 

But when we dig deeper into AZO's balance sheet, we find some concerning abnormalities.

  

[Earnings typically peak in August and Bottom in February](https://preview.redd.it/wjr6c23bscia1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3982814a0cbffca495de4bbab38927ebcab301d4)

I don't prefer to use revenue alone as a means of gauging a company's solvency, as it often doesn't provide a comprehensive explanation of its operations. Operating income is much more comprehensive and equates to *Revenue - Cost of Revenue - Operating Expenses*. This provides a much clearer picture of **how much money a company is actually making from their business.** For AZO, earnings typically peak in August and decline during the Winter months. A decline during this time period is not abnormal. What is abnormal is that AZO's revenue trend is starting to *reverse direction.* This past November's earnings were lower than the year prior, yet the valuation of the stock still implies that the market is pricing in an upward trend.

&#x200B;

[2020 SEC filing showing that issue of $1.2b in notes was responsible for the injection of cash](https://preview.redd.it/91a7tppqvcia1.png?width=1432&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1daa22503a8f82ba9bedec2527384eb8f32169bd)

Cash and Cash equivalents can give us insight into how much liquid capital a company has quick access to if necessary. For the quarter that ended in November 2021, this liquid capital came back down to pre-pandemic levels. This tells us that the large sum of cash raised by issuing notes was quickly spent. It is concerning that such a large sum of money only held them over for a few quarters and without another similar injection, I see them burning through the remaining cash very quickly.

AZO's balance sheet also shows that liabilities are quickly outpacing assets. This is not uncommon, especially for companies that are based out of brick-and-mortar locations. However, This does not leave them much room for error when managing their balance sheet.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e27rgp3nzcia1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5bef1d904fb0372653f51c52e75856824c6465bd

To emphasize the severity of the hemorrhage, AutoZone's working capital currently sits at ***-$2b***. It should be noted that some industries require more working capital than others as their operations aren't as liquid and may not be able to generate short-term capital quickly from customers. Even with this in mind, for the past 2 years, AutoZone has been operating far below its typical threshold for working capital requirements. 

Simply put, AutoZone has never been this strapped for cash in the history of the company. ***Yet its stock valuation is still sitting around its all-time high.*** 

So then, what is AZO's true value?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p5qgagq81dia1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e8736fbcf3ded614f8d615bd4ca11105574d8ef8

Although book value is not always an accurate metric for gauging the value of a company, it still provides some important information. Book value is typically measured as the sum of a company's assets less its liabilities assuming they can be sold. If AutoZone was to hypothetically sell all of its assets and pay off its outstanding obligations *today*, this metric would give us the value investors could expect their shares to be worth. Their shares wouldn't actually yield -$176 to state the obvious, but it does show how deep the bullet lies.

Ultimately, this is not a ""doom and gloom"" post about how I believe AZO is plummeting toward insolvency. I just cannot imagine any justification for a $2,500/share valuation of a company that has the balance sheet of a penny stock. The numbers are larger, sure, but the ratios are eerily similar. This isn't the first stock that I have seen with a grossly inflated valuation, but it is a staple of many mutual funds, trusts, and ETFs. In a risk-off market environment or if macroeconomic sentiment shifts, I can see it as one of the first to go. 

&#x200B;

[Control is wholly owned by institutions](https://preview.redd.it/x0r6ldes5dia1.png?width=1107&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=785e04088e86b1984111099d4da80233d6291400)

[AZO appears to play a key role in many mutual funds](https://preview.redd.it/t25pydnp5dia1.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c878ad2ca29b4a45bc3f9272d89aff805416baf7)

Because funds have been building positions for decades and holding shares, AutoZone has historically been immune to significant downside swings or price volatility in previous years. However, their balance sheet expresses that there are some pretty significant reasons for funds to re-evaluate if they truly want to continue holding a hemorrhaging company.

So far the path for AutoZone's stock has been a straight line, but all good things must come to an end. Gravity will bring it back down to Earth. With an average daily volume profile of around \~100,000 shares, the most pain will come in the form of low liquidity. 

&#x200B;

With 94% of shares owned by institutions, any firm that chooses to sell out of its position will potentiate a downward spiral. When there's a fire nobody wants to be the last one to the exit.

This time, there are **1441** people in the room

To sum it up: Rocketlab last week announced that it has signed a contract with a HUGE undisclosed customer for the purchase of its new reaction wheel product (that was designed for this customer) (reaction wheels are an expensive satellite part and mega constellation such as starlink, all satellites need these), and rocketlab built a facility last year to produce these in high volume, each reaction wheel has a retail price of 100-120K each, each satellite needs roughly 4 of them. with each satellite needing to be replaced every 5 years or so, this is a potentially Billions of dollars worth of reoccurring revenue.

([Rocketlab Builds a massive fucking facility for production of these reaction wheels](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-expands-space-systems-footprint-with-new-high-volume-reaction-wheel-production-facility/))

([Rocketlab announces new reaction wheel for a ""Huge undisclosed mega constellation customer""](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-increases-space-systems-offerings-with-new-products-for-small-satellites/))

Its hard to summarize the whole thing but read my post. I really dig deep in the potential $$

In my post I narrowed it down to be potentially Amazon project Kuipar. which is a huge satellite fleet that would result in Billions of dollars worth of these parts over the next 10 years.

(IM PROBABLY LOSING YOUR INTEREST BECAUSE U DONT KNOW HOW SIGNIFICANT THIS IS, READ TO THE END I PROMISE U ITS WORTH THE TIME)

Well Im fucking doubling down, here is fucking why.

Adam Spice (Rocketlab CFO) a few days ago attended an event and did a presentation on Rocketlab

An investor asked about the new reaction wheels and he answered this and in his response he said two things that caught my eye

""our new 12ms reaction wheel is much bigger than we've ever done and is really targeted towards that one megaconstellation customer we haven't be able to name, but hopefully once they start launching those satellites, we will be able to disclose who they are""

""and now we enter into an agreement with a mega constellation customer, were its THOUSANDS of reaction wheels per year, and much bigger reaction wheels, and what that does is allow us to build a dedicated, high volume production facility in New Zealand""

([Video of CFO talking about it](https://twitter.com/NutscapesNFT))

Here is the info we ALREADY KNEW about this constellation. (please read my other post or you might be a bit confused as I might reference some info from their)

\-But in a nutshell these reaction wheels are designed only for satellites 600-650KG (this isn't roughly, it NEEDS to be precise),

\-Obviously a large customer if they built a facility + designed new product for this customer

Now here is where Adam Spice fucked up. Just because he is not a satellite expert, does not mean us internet regards aren't. He gave way too much information and I have narrowed it to who it could be

So First off I went through every mega constellation planning to be launched (or already launched and sorted by the size of the satellite from 600-650KG

This really only fucking narrows in down to Amazons project Kuipar (Amazons starlink competitor), this is an abnormally large satellite, the only other sat that resemble the size range include the following (see my other post for exact breakdown)

In the video Adam Spice stated that they have not yet launched their satellites yet, which even further narrows it down to project KUIPAR (they have not launched yet)

Adam Spice also said ""once they start launching those satellites, we will HOPEFULLY be able to disclose who they are"". THIS IS HUGE, THIS TELLS US THEY CANNOT DISCLOSE. they want to disclose the customer, but they cant

Why aren't they able to disclose it on their own terms?

Because the company they are launching for is a fucking public company.

If it was a private company they sold to, why would the private company give a flying fuck? also they won't be legally bound to not disclose it, it would be THEIR OPTION as manufacturer. (unless the private company made some weird confidentially clause, which would be very unusual and bizzare as a private company.

Aso we already knew it was going to be a huge contract given they made a new product and facility for it, but Adam nailed the cherry on top. ""We will be making THOUSANDS OF THESE for this customer""

Now each sat is different but its roughly 4 reaction wheels per satellite, (not much of a range, some could need SLIGHTLY more or less)

Thousands (PLURAL) of reaction wheels PER year IS A FUCKING HUGE FLEET

were talking A BASE Of 250 satellites per year (Its MORE, im just using 1000 per year as a starting)

I went through Wikipedia, looked at all the data from satellite fleet size, if they have already started launching or not, public or private, size of satellites (Mass in KG)

Not only does Amazon project Kuipar meet the criteria for ALL of these facts that we know, but all of them simatenaously. VERY FEW of these satellite fleets meet 2+ of these criteria, I could only find a few other other satellites fleets that even resembled the size (off by 50KG in sat size, but even then its hypothetical as reaction wheels must be put in place for exact size of sat), never mind the other conditions.

Some other honourable mentions include

Telesat constellation which satellites are 150KG oversized, and total fleet wouldn't even need 1000 reaction wheels total. (also planning to launch in 2025 lol)

EVEN FUCKING SCRAPPING ALL THE CONDITIONS I LISTED ABOVE, from the video it sounds like the satellites will be launching soon

[Project Kuiper launching sometime ""early 2023""](https://www.satelliteinternet.com/providers/project-kuiper/)

Lets do some more fucking MATH!

if they do supply reaction wheels to project KUIPAR.

Lets go low end at 100k Per reaction wheel

4 reaction wheels per satellite

3236 Sattelites, (keep in mind Leo mega constellation sats die every 5 years roughly and will be replace with new reaction wheels)

Were talking 1.3 billion of reoccurring revenue.

Also even if its not Amazon project Kuipar, which I really do think it is. There really isn't too many mega constellations planning to be launched anytime soon lol

CFO at least confirmed with us that they will be making thousands of reaction wheels per year for this one mega constellation customer (IM TALKING ABSOULUTE BARE MINIMUM)

He said thousands as in plural

so 2000 reaction wheels

he said per year

so lets go 1 year

1 years of manufacturing 2000 wheels per year for one customer = 200million $

What are your guys thoughts? It seems clear as day to me. Can anyone point to who else this would be, im open to counter arguments?  is it just lack of knowledge on the sattelite parts and space industry the reason this hasn't reacted yet? Im freaking out over this, but no one seems to match my energy here lol, im the only one who posts about rocketlab hahahah.

111ke19,PRE- CPI DAY! 2-13-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market analysis,"  

Well lets get right into it‚Ä¶ here is my overall analysis for tomorrow‚Ä¶ I do suspect the highest and best probability of a payout comes from a miss tomorrow. 

CPI YoY is set up to come in over consensus and possible unchanged from previous  
 CPI MoM is set up to come in WAY over previous CPI  
 CORE YoY is set up to come in over consensus and possibly unchanged from pervious like CPI YoY  
 CORE MoM is the real wild card honestly. Based on the data I could beat, be unchanged or miss from previous. 

For me and I might be wrong I think markets are going to focus negatively on this MoM rebound and this will be the first CPI YoY that does not decrease by atleast 0.7% since November.  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wo0io1f9w0ia1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0b33507b2ea3be128bb910aae3773071b4e90f8f

Some very interesting things about this pre-CPI day‚Ä¶ this is the highest the fear and greed index has been on the day before CPI all year long. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cns56rt9w0ia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5bbba15949534a7a0b3bf41ba16db0d2c7b50107

This is only the 3rd pre-CPI day all year long that the VIX closed a red day‚Ä¶ the other two times were October which the VIX closed -0.12% and in May which closed -6.81%. All very interesting to be honest. 

The other very interesting thing about this CPI is that this is the first CPI with a new seasonal adjustment and weight calculation. We also saw this/ last week MoM and YoY CPI revised to the upside for the last few CPI prints too which is very intriguing.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uw3md2aaw0ia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e9f9ccd45b77b30180824345554c4fabe64e947d

As of right now with an IV of 40% and a PC ratio of 1.33 there is not much downside hedges put on and this is one of the lowest IVs going into CPI day that I have seen in a very long time‚Ä¶ 

Tomorrow at 830am is going to be another very interesting day to watch. 

What impressed me the most was that the bulls pretty much straight ripped this green all day long today until 2pm. There is not a lot of risk off going into tomorrow. 

Okay lets take a look at SPY here‚Ä¶ going to keep everything broad as we will get a better direction post CPI tomorrow and see where the cookie crumbles. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/arl55rpaw0ia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ba121985beade943fe413470b91ea3ec589705a8

SPY has a really nice black support line here but also a really nice blue bear channel formed so far here‚Ä¶

Overall the black support line sits at 407.3 and the blue resistance line sits at 412.8.

If we push to the upside we should expect a push to test a major resistance at 419.5 which is about 1.6% from here‚Ä¶ IF we happen to get a huge 3% green day we could see as high as 425. Above 419.5 the next MAJOR resistance is 429.8.

However, if we get a big miss tomorrow and a red open/ day we are going to start looking for 405.3 support (about a -1.8% move) and if we lose that the next MAJOR support is 400 (-3.2%).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/37uhzg8bw0ia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=45243488077550a88778f940b0a48706ff3c69b8

Just as impressive here is futures that it opened and was trading -0.4% almost all night last night only to open green and close up 1.2% today.

We are going to be looking for upside resistance to be tested at 4210 (1.5%+) and 4310 (3.8%+) for our major upside resistance levels. However, to the downside the major levels at 4085 (-1.6%) and 4030 (-2.9%) red day. 

Again tomorrow post CPI we can see where we close out and go from there with some stronger trend and structure.

I honestly was kind of surprised to see Tesla red today‚Ä¶ also today it spent almost 5 hours total today trading around 195. I haven‚Äôt seen Tesla hold that tight of a range for that long in a very long time. That was incredibly impressive. 

Major upside targets for Tesla are 202.4 (4%+) and 215 (10.5%+). Downside targets are 178 (-7.3%) and 163 (-16.3%). Granted I don‚Äôt expect 163 tomorrow but this week or next that would be my target.

Looking at the VIX what an incredible day for the VIX to open at 21.69 and fall al the way back to 20.37 to close at its LOD. An almost 6.5% drop on pre-CPI day for the VIX is really incredible and just shows how much bull hopium this market is holding onto right now‚Ä¶ 

**Daily log-**

Honestly today was terrible day‚Ä¶ I even called on Friday in my TA that we would likely close 410-414 area today‚Ä¶ and well it happened and I didn‚Äôt believe it the whole way up‚Ä¶ The red futures open and the huge VIX drop today threw me off and I kept waiting after the massive bull push this morning for a bigger drop that never came.

The other issue is that because IV/ premiums are so high right now I kept talking myself out of calls saying ‚Äúthere isn‚Äôt enough upside to warrant this play‚Äù and then it would push up and I could had 5-10% a few different times. 

Definitely not my best trading day today‚Ä¶ I look forward to CPI being over tomorrow and seeing what this market wants to do‚Ä¶ If we get a lower CPI and markets receive it well honestly I have little doubt that this bull run doesn‚Äôt continue‚Ä¶ outside of a black swan there just wouldn‚Äôt be anything in my opinion to cause people to sell‚Ä¶ 

Realistically for me unless we get a hotter than expected CPI/ CORE I  just don‚Äôt see what is going to stop this market right now‚Ä¶ JPOW couldn‚Äôt do it‚Ä¶ three of largest stocks all missing on the same day couldn‚Äôt do it‚Ä¶ FOMC couldn‚Äôt do it‚Ä¶ im really not sure what WILL do it‚Ä¶",DaddyDersch,87,1676323327.0

Absolutely zero follow through and some absolutely erratic candle movements chopped me up today. Lets take a look at where the dust has settled‚Ä¶ 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kboe7u8aclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d12f1d69dc7ae2f46b1678e26fecdf9a538b5f1c

All eyes are officially on jobless claims tomorrow‚Ä¶ why is jobless claims tomorrow important? JPOW the last two days has basically re-iterated and other fed talking points have continued to say that we are data dependent and even going into next FOMC we are data dependent. As you cans see by this chart here that we have been trending down on jobless claims (as in there are less and less people saying they are jobless) since December 11th and around the first week of February we ‚Äúbottomed.‚Äù 

The last 3 jobs claims has been higher than previous‚Ä¶ why does this matter? Because if job claims are rising now then that would indicate the economy is ‚Äúweakening‚Äù which then means the feds rate hikes are working. The biggest concern for the fed is that despite what they do the economy as it has since summer continues to ramp up. 

This number is projected at 195k tomorrow which would mean a 4th week in a row that claims rise (economy weakening) and that would be extremely bullishly received. However, if that number comes in below 193k again tomorrow that could signal jobs trending back down and the fears of a 50bps grow‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3zrqvvwaclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=47b3795e8f75c45449b253e81d33ffbed0279abc

As of now‚Ä¶ we have a 77.9% priced in chance (expectation) of a 50bps at the march 22nd meeting which I absolutely find incredible. This is where im at‚Ä¶   
 

markets gonna market until CPI -> CPI is going to come in better than expected (aka bullishly received) -> algos are gonna pick up on that and dump the chances of a 50bps to 0% that day‚Ä¶ -> massive rally into FOMC -> FOMC becomes the top when the dot plot and fed funds rate projections come out terribly hot and unexpected. 

I don‚Äôt think we actually get a 50bps‚Ä¶ unless we get a true CPI YoY/ MoM rebound which I don‚Äôt forsee, however, I am waiting for the consensus to come out this week still. 

**SPY SUPPLY/ DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gy2z0ahbclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a983b96730035c29843e9257607773176c2bc03b

Today the daily chart came down and touched the 396.54 supply. Now this came within 4 cents on the daily time frame which on a daily time frame is within the room of error. However, this is a key level to keep in mind if we reject the downside. With the current technical on SPY we are actually looking to establish a new demand (support) at this 398.2 range. If we were to put in a green day tomorrow, especially if we could see a close over 401.5 there is a solid chance that today and yesterdays lows establish a new demand (support) at 398.2‚Ä¶. a demand being established over previous demand at 394.68 would be extremely bullish and I would once again start thinking about a push back to the upper range resistance of 405.17. 

Spy very well leading into CPI next week could find itself stuck between a 398 and 405 choppy range. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yh1c6k1cclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bd18ecc3b2a050e2c84b40a140ffe8c0f18f8dcb

From a daily price action stand point we have reached a bounce point. This pattern actually is playing out beautifully. If you go back to Thursday we started a three day $12+ pump. It was natural to expect that to result in a retrace to back fill some of these levels. Now that we have back filled the actual daily gap and came down to find support on the daily 100ema‚Ä¶ with this morning doji start pattern we should expect a push back to 402 tomorrow minimally. That would put us back at a retest of the daily 20ema. 

Now that‚Äôs from strictly a technical standpoint‚Ä¶ IF jobs come in low and algos dump us then I would start targeting 394.6 demand area for a potential bounce. 

We have found ourselves exactly where we were on Monday. From a technical/ price action and even supply/ demand stand point this is 100% a call opportunity and I 100% expect upside‚Ä¶ however, much like Monday we had a major catalyst that can negate the technical temporarily or can support the technical much like Tuesday did. 

SPY Levels:

Supply- 405.17 -> 414.13   
 Demand- 394.68 -> 388.52  
 Daily support- 398.4 -> 396.4 -> 394.6 -> 392.6  
 Daily Resistance- 399.6 -> 401.5 -> 404.5

**FUTURES SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bjygdtmcclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2030405bcd62de1297f254d60312f102fa23ce0f

Taking a look at futures supply and demand we have found ourselves in ‚Äúno mans land.‚Äù We are under the recently established 4055 supply and we are just over the 3960 demand (support) below us. Looking at the technical if we were to have another bullish day tomorrow we could be attempting to establish todays low of 3990 as a new demand (support). That would much like SPYS daily S/D be very bullish. With the demands (supports) stacked like that from 3920 to potentially 3990 (this would also turn previous supply of 3990 into a new demand) that is very bullish. I would then look for a push back to 4055 and potentially even attempt to take out demand at 4096 if we got a big enough bounce. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vykt6q3dclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f51a5dc781a4e46a4c74477fe4f306d4f5407042

From a daily price action stand point on futures is much of the same with this classic morning doji star/ double bottom off 3990 support today. This on futures is also a retest and support holding for the 100ema. 

With this price action (again dependent on data‚Ä¶) we should see a push to the upside tomorrow. My ultimate futures target is 4020 which would give us a close back over the daily 8, 50 and 200ema and ultimately would make me expect a rally back to the 4053 supply and possibly even as high as 4095 on Friday depending on data. 

However, in the chance that data is negatively received my ultimate downside target is a support test of 3920. This should be a major support test and as long as that holds then ultimately we should expect a push back to the 4000s. However, a closure under 3920 would be extremely bearish and could very well start a further sell off. 

Futures Levels:

Supply: 4055 -> 4160  
 Demand: 3920 -> 3960 -> 4096  
 Daily Support- 3990 -> 3955  
 Daily Resistance- 4020 -> 4055 -> 4085

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cph6ti5eclma1.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0fc53da399a0b78e0eb4b8676ea6272ca7d0af5a

The VIX is actually in an interesting place. I also mentioned yesterday that I was surprise with the fact that a 50bps is now nearly 70%+ ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù that the VIX did not break through 19.7. That is very odd if you ask me‚Ä¶ now granted markets have absolutely been focusing on the use of 0dte options instead of longer DTE‚Ä¶ but if markets truly ‚Äúbelieved‚Äù that we were going to get 50bps, and that cpi would be red hot we would be seeing a much longer and more importantly sustained spike on the VIX. However, today we are seeing yet again the VIX unwind. 

The VIX remains at that 19.7 resistance at in a bear flag breakdown pattern that should lead once again to another drop to that 18.3 support rea. 

**DXY**

Now im going to start this with a disclaimer‚Ä¶ I generally have watched the DXY and 10yr yield since probably mid summer time. However, I have never once taken a trade solely based off it. I do enjoy watching in general dollar/ yield up = spy SHOULD be down‚Ä¶ now many of you know that does not always happen. Yields/ DXY have been moving in tandem with SPY which is interesting. Some are even saying that yields have finally gone too far‚Ä¶ however, long story short im going to start watching DXY more closely and see if we can see anything. Merely going to talk out loud and see if there is any bigger correlations we can catch. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z9q54dcfclma1.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=eb30751cb9524d4f752eafda6681c768a8016626

From a price action stand point DXY is in an overall massive rising wedge that dates back to January/ February. As of now price remains over its daily 8ema and had officially closed over the 105.6 level which was the high back form December. 

Just for reference at this time period when DXY was at 105.6 area in beginning of December SPY was at trading in the 380s range (this was directly post December CPI). This means we are about 4.7% higher on SPY now than we were back then. 

Current trend would allow for DXY to fall as low as 104.7 by Monday (day before CPI) and rise as high as 106.4. 

**10YR YIELD**

I am starting with the same disclaimer here that I am merely watching the 10yr like this in order to see if we catch anything to help us. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3kuzyfhgclma1.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=577c061cae9c1a841bedde96b9a9edac387c4d8a

The 10yr is in this same rising wedge pattern as DXY. Which I actually find interesting as SPY daily is in a breakout triangle pattern which I full expect it to hold within leading into CPI. This rising wedge on DXY/ 10yr COULD be the hint that we actually see a breakout to the upside on SPY which also supports my thesis on a bullishly received CPI. 

Currently the 10yr is sitting just under 4% after briefly breaching it today. For reference on the 10yr the last time it was this high was back in November. At which time SPY held that 395 to 405 range leading into CPI before it saw the bigger dump. In that sense we are actually spot on with where we should be here‚Ä¶ 

From a TA stand point we actually have a pretty nice but ugly head and shoulders or W pattern formed here with our lows at that 3.4% area and highs here at the 4% area‚Ä¶ that would indicate that the 10yr will sell off and that would lead to a pump on SPY‚Ä¶ 

Overall from a macro stand point 10yr and DXY suggest we are in a place where they are likely to retrace which might be support by jobs data and CPI and that could lead to a rally on SPY. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

https://preview.redd.it/dov27gxgclma1.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ecae56dc960833f0454cd5fc2ce4053ddb1d43b4

I got pretty chopped up today and some how managed to put in a decently small red day and still have a pretty nice green week. I recognized early on today that morning range and chop. I took the first opportunity for a call when we broke out over 399 and closed there this morning and was immediately stopped out. With the massive wicks on the 15min chart I once again waited for the breakout and when we broke out around 1145 and closed a new HOD I once again was immediately stopped out. 

I still looking back have no good reason or data to support why from 12 until 130pm we went on that massive dump from HOD to LOD like that. It really was fully against the technical at the time.

Best play of the day was the 14dte calls I took near the 3971 support are on futures (a major weekly support). That rogue EOD pump printed calls nicely and turned what was going to be a pretty sour day into just an annoying day. 

Frustrating to feel like I was behind and buying the top/ bottom on every play. However, I will say that I followed my rules and almost every play I took everything I look for in an entry (especially the first 3 calls I stopped out of) were all 100% signaled.. as in I have everything I look for with a perfect call entry. I wont let one day change my strategy as its tried and true‚Ä¶ after a successful day yesterday with the volatility today was a humbling reminder that FED days do not generally fit into my ideal trading strategy. 

At the end of the day though tomorrows a new day and there will always be a new day‚Ä¶ we have to at time know when to walk away and know when the day just isn‚Äôt going to give us what we need.",DaddyDersch,87,1678314269.0

Consumer debt is at $4.8 Trillion up $400M from a year ago and up $800M prior to covid in 2019

Guess how much of that is student loans? $1.8 Trillion or almost 40%. 

Is this the catalyst that will break the camels back and cause the recession? Probably not. If you exclude the student loan debt from the picture. Consumer debt is around normal levels if not lower.

11csa4m,"SPY Technical Analysis for Monday February 27, 2023 - SPY caught in a tight squeeze between 200 and 50-day moving averages","# Swaps Predict Rate Hikes and Peak Rate by July - February 24 Recap

Wall Street's response to the higher-than-anticipated inflation data showed that the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening campaign has a long road ahead, diminishing the likelihood of a gentle landing.

Volatility has risen after a prolonged period of calm stock movements. Beyond economic uncertainties, this is due to an expensive market resulting from a buoyant rally since October. These gains are decreasing day by day, as concerns of an impending recession have clouded the outlook for American companies.

The S&P 500 declined even further on Friday, deepening its worst weekly downturn in 2023. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 plummeted almost 2% as the two-year treasury yield hit its highest since 2007 at 4.8%, while the dollar rose. Swaps are currently pricing in 25 basis point hikes at the Fed's next three meetings, and wagers on the peak rate have climbed to approximately 5.4% by July. The benchmark lies between 4.5% and 4.75%.

The unexpected surge in the personal consumption expenditures gauge revealed the dangers of continuously high inflation. Moreover, resilient spending combined with the exceptional strength of the labor market may make it more challenging for the Fed to meet its 2% inflation objective. In contrast, separate data showed that consumer sentiment climbed to its highest level in a year, while new home sales exceeded forecasts.

# Pending home sales report for January expected to show a 2.5% increase

On Monday, February 27th, several major U.S. economic reports and Fed speakers will take center stage.

The day kicks off with the release of January's durable goods orders report, which is expected to show a 5.6% increase. Additionally, the core orders report for the same period will also be released. Median forecasts for this report predict a -0.1% change, indicating a possible decline in demand for long-lasting goods.

Later in the morning, the pending home sales report for January will be released, which is expected to show a 2.5% increase.

Finally, Fed Governor Jefferson is scheduled to speak at 10:30 am, providing valuable insights into the Fed's current outlook and potential policy shifts

# SPY trading between 200 and 50-day moving averages

The SPY is currently trading between its 200 and 50-day moving averages on a daily basis. We noticed some buying activity near the 393 level that we discussed last week. As we approach the prior resistance diagonal backtest and the uptrend support line, there could be a potential pivot zone around 393, 390, and 387. I'm anticipating a possible struggle and increased choppiness in the market this week.

Assuming we do experience a rebound at this level, I'll be keeping an eye on the sell side discount in the vicinity of the 404-406 area.

## Expected Move Based on Patterns

#### What is a rising wedge pattern?

The rising wedge is a common technical chart pattern utilized to detect potential trend reversals in financial markets. This pattern emerges as an upward-sloping price chart with two converging trendlines. Decreasing trading volume frequently accompanies this formation. Wedges can appear in either a rising or falling direction. A rising wedge is generally viewed as a bearish chart pattern that suggests a potential downward breakout.

* Timeframe: 15m
* Bearish Bias

* Half measured move: 393.58

11o5jer,How major US banks could be at risk of sweeping defaults,"
With the recent implosion of SVB (Silicon Valley Bank), it's important to start looking under the rug before all of the roaches start running all over the place. In a nutshell, we know a few things have happened:

1. Trillions of dollars were printed and we aren't going to escape the effects of it.
2. Interest rates are up enough to really start killing off borrowing demand, to the tune of 20% volume of mortgage starts versus one year ago.
3. US consumer credit debt is way up, and personal savings are way down.
4. Treasuries are paying 4.5%+ and mortgages are up near 7%. Companies with too large of a disparity between what they pay out in corporate bonds and what they receive from risk free interest will be especially in danger, much like SVB.
5. If you look here- [https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/default.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/default.htm) you'll find that all the major US commercial banks have about $2T in residual (assets minus liabilities), about a 10% margin over their liabilities. Assets=22T, Liabilities=20T.

All it takes to start forcing banks to sell assets is 2 trillion dollars in losses. That's it. SVB is imploding over a $15B loss and JP Morgan is rumored to have $47B in unrealized losses on their books. *EDIT: the big 4 banks are at $114B in losses as of this moment with some estimates showing $600B in total unrealized losses across the banking sector* It's not a loss til you sell, right? Consumer credit card debt alone has reached $1 trillion. Most people no longer have adjustable rate mortgages, so we can discount that one, but the commercial mortgage industry isn't so tidy. It was more or less forgotten when regulations were tightened post-2008.

The numbers as of March 1st 2023-

MBS (mortgage backed securities) makes up 2.7 Trillion dollars

Commercial real estate makes up 2.9T

Residential makes up 2.5T

These are just a few, the link above has all the data.

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS) shows that the credit card loan default rate has crept up to 2.25% as of Q4 2022.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/03/06/auto-loan-delinquencies-up-in-2022/11393399002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/03/06/auto-loan-delinquencies-up-in-2022/11393399002/) \---6% of all subprime auto loans are late on payments.

Oh, and let's not forget inflation is somewhere between 6-8% YoY, and real inflation is as high as 20% solely based on dollars printed and money devalued. AND the M2 money supply is shrinking at a rate synonymous with economic depressions. M2 has only decreased from $21.7T to $21.2T since Feb 2022, representing a $500B drop or 2.3%.

All of this is to say, for the banks to be squeezed to the tune of $2 trillion from all of the above factors isn't much. If you take away the drop in M2 money supply, you're at $1.5T. If you take away an additional 8% from their assets since Feb 2022 due to inflation, you're already in the red ($1.5T-1.76T= -.26T). Now, that might be an exaggeration or conflation of factors. But if you even start to get close to 5-8% default rates on commercial loans (which are going to be hit harder due to a drop in consumer spending)- you wipe out another $150 Billion to $232 Billion. Not to mention what happens if MBS counted as assets on the banks books start to get dumped (again). Technically, if MBS, commercial, and residential properties collectively lose 10-30% of their value, this whole thing starts to get really ugly. This can all get out of hand quickly, especially if there are people who try to pull all of their money out of the banks because as we know, fractional reserve banking means they probably don't have enough to assuage the fears of the public at large.....

Even if the banks don't fully go into the red due to defaults, if they start to get close there's a good chance they'll have to start selling assets and unwinding liabilities to maintain adequate reserves per federal regulation, or risk going down completely. And once that selling starts, you better buckle up because the more of those assets that hit the market from various commercial banks, the less those assets will be worth on the open market due to supply outweighing demand.

We will more than likely end up in a situation where the Fed raises rates, attempting to execute a 'soft landing' but once the dominoes start to fall, it's very difficult to stop rolling defaults. First, consumers default on credit card loans, then home loans and auto loans, then businesses default on loans and fail to pay their leases, REIT's start to get squeezed, banks are unable to recover a large chunk of loaned out money, and all of a sudden you have banks creeping up on default, requiring a bailout from big daddy warbucks, the government. Even assets sold to recuperate borrowed money will become worth less than the loan value itself if there is too much selling at once.

The ideal play here is to be cash heavy once the selling really starts. You could try to time the market and buy some puts, but you might also get royally screwed if the party keeps going for longer than expected. The issue that stocks will find themselves in is that treasuries at 4.5% look very attractive if you're expecting a down year, which as more banks start having problems, people may very well get spooked and sell off their equities to sit in cash or treasuries/money market funds.

I've moved to about 20% cash, piled some into FAZ to short the banks with leverage (not ideal due to decay, I know), and I'm piling up cash in the event that real estate becomes more attractive, because you'd be able to buy at a discount and refinance once this all cools down in 3-5 years as is historically typical. Ultimately I like my stronger stocks like AAPL, GOOG, etc. I've sold over half my NVDA stake after the recent run-up because well, 100% gains in a few months is a little much, don't you think? A good bit of my cash on hand is sitting in a fund gaining 4.5% until I decide to deploy it in the event of a massive cascading selloff.",zulufux999,76,1678493875.0
11gj983,Temporary bottom or dead cat bounce?... 3-2-23 SPY/ ES Futures Daily Market Analysis,"I had some questions yesterday about my supply/ demand levels on SPY and why they may have seemed ‚Äúoff.‚Äù So let me explain a little. 

The gauge/ indicator identifies new levels either supply or demand. and unless it ""takes it out"" then its still there. Thats where this price action on SPY is VERY weird because like you said we should NOT establish a supply and then be over it and be under a demand like that either. however, with the current price action and these wild 1% +/- gap ups/ downs thats where the technicals are showing something that just isn‚Äôt quite playing out yet‚Ä¶ it just is an testament to how odd this price action has been and how irrational it truly has been. (below information is from last night not todays charts/ price action). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uq0mqvvcqela1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dce14a8e43717623fd24278596669c5fbf001cfe

The issue is that its not flipping the name of supply/ demand but the issue is because SPY is only intraday trading but really its tracking with ES we are getting these massive gap ups that is messing price action up... look at futures and you can see its not like that at all... we ARE breaking through previous 3975 demand but just established a new one at 3960 which makes sense. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lxsr3cedqela1.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=09c69e16d3b302d796351150fcf416db30674766

However, looking at SPY here this is the issue... so we formed super nice resistance at that 414+ area and then we started our descent and the way the price action has happened we put in demand at 405.74. From there we had a really nice bounce which took out a demand at 409.6... this opens downside back to the demand. So the issue comes in that we had that huge 2% drop last Tuesday which then resulted in a goofy massive wick day on Thursday that established a demand.

The next issue is that we did not push up to take out the 405.7 demand we just continued to dump.

Same thing this week we had a huge absolutely weird movement on Friday cause of data which put in oddly a supply (granted not a strong one but its there and enough to note)... and now we are pushing back down...

So what REALLY needs to happen to ""balance"" this out is for SPY to establish demand down here somewhere form 388 to 396. push all the way back to 405.74 demand. and then either retrace to confirm a new demand. or establish that as a new supply and then we can start our fall back down.

So what im saying and honestly its funny (I posted all this last night in the TA comments but just recapping it) is that we are seeing this play out now‚Ä¶ in this scenario we will push back to 400.7/ 3990 area and then we will be more balanced and looking better technical wise.

If you were wondering what the change today and the massive pump came from was Bostic‚Ä¶ So just like that a 50bps scare flash crashes the market and then a 25bps discussion spikes the market‚Ä¶

Oddly enough the current estimate is still at 30% for a 50bps and has not come down. Im not sure if this CME is live or not so this probably overnight will see an adjustment. 

Where does that leave us then? Are we bullish? Bearish? Or is this a temporary bottom? Relief bounce? 

&#x200B;

Lets take a look at our current supply and demand daily levels. Today was a big day for sure. 

On SPY we have established with this push up today 394.7 as a new demand level. With that demand on SPY itself we have an upside demand of 400.7 and 405.7. Now SPY is as I mentioned yesterday in extreme bear momentum so most bounces should reject off the daily 8ema. However, if we can close a green day tomorrow we very well could break that extreme bear momentum as we had just entered it on the 27th and are not very deep into it yet. 

If we can continue momentum tomorrow my target would be 400.7 demand level which is going to corelate perfectly with a daily 20ema resistance test. 

On SPY supply wise we have that 396.5 area and besides that the next major supply level is up near 414-417. 

Supply and demand for SPY wise the most bullish case here which is support by indicator is that we will go up tomorrow potentially as high as 400.7 (but honestly we don‚Äôt need to go that high), establish a NEW supply somewhere over 396.5. Then early next week a healthy retrace to take out that 396.5 supply and potentially confirm demand at 394.6 would absolutely open upside to 405 area. This is the scenario I most closely am watching for. 

On a bearish supply and demand case for SPY If we were to fail to breakout to 400.7 which is probable since we did not have any meaningful pullback today and we establish a new supply up here this could have been a dead cat bounce. IF that happens and we reject this daily 8ema retest here especially if we double top then I would be eyeing us to come down and retest previous demand at 388.5 early next week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/39df6aafqela1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4cbf0631618efd9816c6de81fb88c60926d3b3b8

Taking a look at the daily chart here you can see we broke through that red falling wedge/ bear channel which does give us upside to the black resistance which will be around 401.9 tomorrow and also coordinates with a daily 20ema resistance retest. 

Bulls were able to retake the daily 100ema today however, they are going to face heavy resistance as we come into that 400 to 400.6 level as that is the daily 50/200ema and that is previous demand and we should have the daily 20ema lingering right above there. 

With this daily bullish engulfing candle here I remain short term bullish. I really was hoping for this to hold closing to 397 and see a bigger pullback to take out some 15 minute chart supplies down at 396 first. With the daily 8ema being here and extreme momentum we are likely to see a rejection here or at least minimally retest support down below. I was planning to long here with a 30dte call however we did not pullback and I do believe that will come tomorrow. 

There is potential if bulls can close on a bullish note tomorrow‚Ä¶ which would be a close over 396.4 that this is a bullish and I would suspect a run up next week into CPI. 

Supply- 396.5 -> 414.13 

Demand- 394.64 -> 400.7 -> 405.7

Key SPY Support- 394.6 -> 392.7 -> 391.5

Key SPY Resistance- 397.9 -> 400 -> 400.7 -> 401.6

Taking a look here at the futures daily supply/ demand chart you can see that we nearly last night came down within 5 pts of the 3920 demand from 1/19. While we did not touch it that is still very bullish in nature to have that long of a wick. Now this is where TOS and TV differ but on TOS this is a double bottom/ bullish engulfing candle with is bullish. 

With a new demand now established at 3960 we have officially taken out previous 3975 demand. You can see though as I mentioned on Spy with us being in extreme bear momentum that the most probable place for a rejection is the daily 8ema which is where we rejected and not only that but we rejected off that 3990 supply. 

If bulls can continue momentum there is a case to be made where we could close over 4020 tomorrow, establish a new supply and then end up coming back down next week to take out 4015 and 3990 supply. This would be very bullish. If bulls lose 3960 on a retest though that would signify that we are gong to come back down to that 3920 demand eventually. 

On the daily I do see on both SPY and futures a IV drop (bullish) and I do see reversal conditions set up volatility wise. This could all set us up for this to actually be the temporary bottom. 

My thoughts are with the fed members talking about 25bps now and talking about how CPI was a fake rebound (or temporary) that this actually is setting us up for a rally back to 405 next week prior to CPI. 

&#x200B;

Taking a look here at futures you can see the same thing that we are coming in closely here on the daily 100ema and 8ema. Both of which did hold as resistance today. IF this continues tomorrow upward the 4020 level is going to be a major resistance level as that is going to be the daily 20, 50 and 200 ema along with being a previous supply level. 

From a bullish standpoint a closure over 3975 tomorrow would be extremely bullish for the weekly timeframe. 

Supply- 3990 -> 4015

Demand- 3920 -> 3960 -> 4096

Key Futures Support- 3975 -> 3960 -> 3945 -> 3920

Key Futures Resistance- 3985 -> 3990 -> 4016 -> 4020

**TESLA TA will no longer be included.** I have found I am being pulled in too many places.. my own fault‚Ä¶ I will no longer be focusing on Tesla in my daily TA. It is something I will chat about occasionally but it just isn‚Äôt something I plan to trade anymore.

Taking a look at the VIX here this was a pretty impressive drop on the VIX. We actually have broken back under 19.6 for the first time since February 16th. Which was the first day of the current down trend that we are in. This 19.6 is a pretty major pivot level here and this could also with this massively bearish engulfing candle signify a local bottom. 

I do think the evidence of a bottom is there and I do think that if we close over 3975 tomorrow that there is a high probability that we see a push to the upside next week. 

Next week is pre-CPI week which historically does move a good amount. The case of a rally into CPI now instead of a dump into CPI is growing here. We have two more fed speakers tomorrow and we will have to see what they have to say compared to what the fed speakers said today.

Overall day trading today and really this week has been pretty excellent. I am very satisfied with my trading and how the week has gone. Strictly from a day trading perspective one of my better weeks in a while. 

Today I finally cut my AMD and Nvidia swings for a loss from last week. I really should have waited on Nvidia earnings before I opened AMD/ nvidia last week but honestly based off other tech I had very little to suggest they would beat let alone rally 12% like they did. I also though that would be a blow off top and would drop us even lower after. 

Unfortunately I considered pretty much all day cutting AMD which was around -25 to -28% all day and Nvidia around -60 to -65% all day. I finally decided by EOD I would cut them and then that investor decided to announce a huge stake in AMD and I watched the price pump $1.2 before my eyes and premiums drop a top. I bailed then and im glad I did as that took a huge pump right after. 

Looking at my long puts I was able to close them all besides AMD and Nvidia for profits. I had plenty of opportunities (especially on AMD‚Ä¶) to close them for much less but I kept holding thinking it would finally retrace. 

Would I take the play again? Yes but I would have waited till after earnings this time. Not a big deal gonna close my week red but that‚Äôs alright. I still like the trade in the end of the day.",DaddyDersch,74,1677798393.0

So lets talk about what happened yesterday with the 50bps rate hike rumors‚Ä¶ now Bullard from what I understand actually hinted at that at last meeting and markets did not react. Now the market FINALLY with CPI, PPI and the 50bps took an absolute nose dive. Now the very interesting this is that despite that yesterday markets still found itself in a buy the dip movement today. 

Think about it this way‚Ä¶ markets have pretty much been on edge all week long and realistically were hella overdue for a technical support sell off and retesting of key support in order to push higher‚Ä¶ that 50bps hike was the catalyst. However, markets came to their senses in my opinion and realized that those two fed members don‚Äôt even get a vote‚Ä¶ markets realized also that realistically we have another CPI before FOMC and honestly the sell off MIGHT be slightly premature‚Ä¶ there is a very high probability that until next CPI and FOMC we find ourselves in a very broad $10-$15 consolidation period like we have now. IT makes trading extremely hard but as of right now there is not enough bull fuel to take this rally to 430 but there really isn‚Äôt enough fuel either to take us back to 390‚Ä¶. Enters consolidation‚Ä¶

Now earlier this week I asked the question ‚Äúis 405 or 420 coming next?‚Äù well we officially have the answer that 405 was coming first‚Ä¶ with 405 tagged and most importantly that support holding there is a high probability this push up continues next week. 

I remain bullish but only in the sense that I believe much like November to December we have found ourselves in a bigger consolidation range from 406 to 417.

This is now our 2nd retest and most importantly our second time holding 405.3 support on a breakdown. I fully expect upside early next week into FOMC minutes on Wednesday. 

Remember we get a really long weekend here too‚Ä¶ generally speaking I would say most 3 day weekends have resulted in bigger green days and opens.

Economic data wise not a whole lot and nothing pre market Tuesday. FOMC minutes is on Wednesday though. 

Today was monthly options expiration and honestly it was a pretty boring day overall pretty tight $3.46 range day. 

Lets take a look at the last few monthly OPEX days‚Ä¶ 

January 20th (opex)= 1.86%+  
 January 23rd (post- OPEX)= 1.2%

December 16th (OPEX)= -1.63%  
 December 19th (post- OPEX)= -0.85%

November 18th (OPEX)= 0.45%+  
 November 21st (post- OPEX)= -0.36%  
 

Overall looking at the last 3 MOPEX‚Ä¶ there is literally trend at all‚Ä¶ however of the last two MOPEX this is definitely one of the smaller movement days.

Now lets take a look here at SPY daily‚Ä¶

Overall we broke through that bull channel support but as I have highlighted here with that black arrows we actually look like we are in an overall upchannel and this very well with retaking the daily 20ema there EOD could end up being a bullish bounce. 

I have mentioned the importance of that 405.3 support area and how as long as we hold that we are bullish. 

You can see that double level at 410.3 to 411.3 and that should be our expected magnet. As in the further we get away from that +/- we SHOULD expect a rebound back to it. 

Todays daily candle structure today with this upside gap of 407.51 to 408.18 actually forms an amazing bullish abandoned baby pattern. This is a high probability upside reversal pattern. I feel fairly confident that we will minimally Tuesday touch somewhere between 408 to 410.3. From there we then start looking at a daily 8ema resistance retest. A closure back over that is extremely bullish however a closure under it/ rejection at it would be very bearish. There is also an overall with the red channel bigger bull flag pattern forming on SPY daily here too.

Now the weekly chart here is actually starting to look a little more bearish. However, if you look at the week of December 19th and 27th we are actually seeing a similar pattern here and with this holding the weekly 8ema support this could be an overall bigger weekly bull flag too. The upside push would get us back to that 417+ area. 

Taking a look here this 407 area has really solidified itself as a major pivot area here. Looking at the resistance from the week of November 28th you can see we actually have a really nice support bounce off that level here this week. After a breakout the week of January 30th over that level this very well could be shaping up to be a bullish support bounce and we attempt once more to reach the allusive 420. 

Key SPY Weekly Support- 407.1 -> 402.6 -> 398.6 -> 395.6

Key SPY Weekly Resistance- 412.3 -> 417 -> 422.4 -> 427.7

I actually looking at the futures daily chart am even more bullish than I am on SPY daily‚Ä¶ and here is why‚Ä¶ so we look at this 4085 level I have mentioned numerous times that that 4085 to 4095 is a major level to keep an eye on and I also mentioned that realistically there is not much contested support from 4040 to 4085. 

Today we came down all the way back to 4055 before we finally bounced‚Ä¶ not only that but we ended up in a massive absolutely beautiful morning doji star reversal candle. With this reversal candle like this we should expect a push back up to that 4120 area. This 4085 support area if you look back at it was first rejected on January 27th. And then on FOMC day feb 1st we bounced off and confirmed that as support again. Much like on February 10th we had a biggest retrace and then bounce off these 4085 support area. Now that this daily candle body failed to break that key support and we have a massive wick to the downside we should expect a push back into the 4100s minimally next week. 

&#x200B;

Now the weekly futures chart here is a bit of a mixed bag here‚Ä¶ on one hand we hard rejected that 4150 level 3 weeks ago and now have lost that key support area of 4095 and failed to close back over it to end the week. However, when we look back at the week of November 28th/ December 5th it established the key level of 4075 and that level was retested and confirmed on the week of January 30th. With futures failing to close under key 4075 and bouncing off the weekly 8ema one could assume that there will be an upside push next week to retest that 4150 resistance area. Again there is a convincing case of a bull flag here on the weekly chart. 

Key Futures weekly support- 4075 -> 4020 -> 3970 -> 3920

Key Futures weekly resistance- 4095 -> 4150 -> 4225

Looking at tesla here we are seeing that we did once again break through support here on the bull channel but impressively after losing the daily 8ema at open and opening under it and rejecting that key 201.9 resistance for a while today we have found ourselves once again on a move to 215 next week. 

215 remains an absolute brick wall which actually reminds me a lot of the fight at 197. IF bulls can break through that level then we could see quite the blow off top before we finally see a major correction. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c2t931yyauia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=80bebb38bed6f3fe761e1df5316520485a8d56cf

The weekly on tesla is actually fairly bullish here. We had a breakout and rejection of that weekly 50ema and after last week forming that potential reversal doji candle the bulls managed to hold the weekly 200ema support retest. The fact that bulls continued to hold that weekly support remains bullish. However we have now come into this major 208.4 resistance level from November 7th. If bulls can break through that and close over that we might see a bigger push for that weekly 100ema at 223.5.

Key Tesla weekly support- 197.4 -> 189.6 -> 178.2

Key Tesla weekly resistance- 208.4 -> 226.4

&#x200B;

So I have mentioned before that if SPY/ Futures is showing a reversal pattern (such as the abandoned baby/ morning doji star) and the VIX is showing the opposite pattern which currently its showing a evening doji star reversal (granted this candle body is very long for the true pattern‚Ä¶ but with the failure to breakout and bigger reversal the pattern is there just not the physical candle structure) then there is a very high probability swing play. 

With the VIX having that massive 10.65% green double bottom yesterday and for most of the day threatening to breakout to that key 21.5 resistance but failing to do so and closing back at 20 we should expect a continuation sell off next week (on the VIX) which then should provide an upside push on SPY itself. 

We have seen these inverse reversal patterns (where spy shows the opposite reversal pattern to VIX ) play out time and time again. It is one of the highest probability setups we have and I will happily take it every time.

Overall not the best week of trading here‚Ä¶ unfortunately put in three red days in a row (no help to CPI swing) to start the week off. That really put me in a pretty good sized hole. However with all things considered Thursday and Friday had a 100% win rate and I was able to be extremely profitable and close at a relatively small loss for the week. 

My biggest struggle this week came with that 11am to really 2pm price action. We found ourselves much like today stuck in some extreme choppy ranges that couldn‚Äôt quite break out. 

My biggest struggle this week came from the physical price action that we saw not being complimented by indicators and overall movement on SPY. Definitely a tough week but after three really tough days to start the week I was happy to finish the week on a strong note. It was refreshing to through drawdown stick to my rules and be able to turn in some really nice plays to end the week. 

Overall despite a red week i obeyed my rules, I didn‚Äôt break my rules and I have no regrets. Honestly even playing CPI lotto puts I have no regrets. When we look at the PPI reaction its actually mind boggling that a hotter PPI got a bigger bear reaction that physical CPI did‚Ä¶ actually what is even more mind boggling is the fact that a non voting fed members whispering 50bps hike can elicit a bigger reaction that hard cold data like CPI can‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs the way these algos work.

# Wall Street sugar daddy who fell for Manhattan stripper sues

Story by Melissa Koenig For Mailonline ‚Ä¢ Yesterday 9:19 PM*373 Comments*

üì∑

AWall Street financier is suing a stripper after he leant her hundreds of thousands of dollars and a Gucci scarf when COVID shut down her club.

John Leahy, of Union, [Michigan](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/michigan/index.html), filed the suit against Aline Luz Dunga and her mother, Annalu Gomez, in Manhattan [Supreme Court](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/us-supreme-court/index.html) on February 24, alleging that they never paid him back the money he leant them over a three year span.

He claims in the suit that he fell for Aline Luz Dunga when he first met her at her job as an exotic dancer, and thought they were in a serious relationship as he spent $125,000 to help her through the global pandemic.

Leahy also claimed he once leant Dunga his Gucci scarf, which she never gave back, and helped pay her mother's [cancer](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/cancer/index.html) treatments and [Massachusetts](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/massachusetts/index.html) state taxes before they stopped speaking with him.

He also spent several¬†thousand to help Gomez, Dunga's mother, pay off her state taxes and cancer treatments Documents obtained by DailyMail.com show Gomez had a history of defaulted loans in the past.¬†

11hg9hc,Ken Griffin‚Äôs hedge fund Citadel is up again in 2023 following a record year,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/03/griffins-citadel-hedge-fund-is-up-again-in-2023-after-a-record-year.html

Billionaire investor Ken Griffin‚Äôs flagship hedge fund matched the broader market‚Äôs performance in the beginning of 2023 following a record year, according to a person familiar with the returns.

Citadel‚Äôs multi-strategy flagship Wellington fund gained 0.7% last month, bringing its 2023 performance to 2.8% through February, the person said. The S&P 500
 lost 2.6% in February, but is still up 3.4% this year through the end of last month.

The stock market staged a rebound in 2023, led by beaten-down tech shares, as investors bet that the worst of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs tightening cycle is over. But some big name investors like Greenlight‚Äôs David Einhorn believe that stocks have more room to fall.

This year‚Äôs gain comes after a stellar year for the hedge fund, which soared 38% in 2022, marking the firm‚Äôs best year ever and outperforming its largest competitor, Millennium, by more than 3 to 1. Citadel has also racked up a nearly 117% return over the three-year period from 2020 to 2022.

Hedge funds aim to offer downside protection during market turmoil, and Citadel managed to shine during the worst chaos in the market in years. The S&P 500 tumbled into a bear market in 2022 as recession fears intensified on the back of the Fed‚Äôs aggressive rate hikes to tame the highest inflation in 40 years.

Macro hedge funds, those making bets around political or economic events, have fared particularly well as tighter monetary policy from global central banks stoked wild moves in different asset classes, from bonds to stocks, and commodities to currencies.

Citadel‚Äôs equities fund, which uses a long/short strategy, is up 2.4% this year, while its global fixed income fund is higher by 1.6% so far in 2023, the person said.

Citadel‚Äôs assets under management exceeded $54 billion as of the start of 2023.

>TLDR, Kenny Boy is making returns that his competitors don't even come close to without explanation. There is no way this is possible without acquiring information not publicly available to his competitors OR (more likely) Citadel must be taking a lot of risks to make these returns for a hedge fund.

113geh5,China Gov't is broke be aware! The signs are there.,"Disclaimer: Most not all of you WSB'ers didn't believe me when I posted about Pfizer earlier in the year so hear this now a second heads up for you guys.   

Note relating to China: A few months ago I let you guys know that the rumors in many circles was that the real reason why China stopped Zero Covid policy was actually because the Chinese govt had run out of money to keep paying the medical and social security for the elderly, they needed people to die so that they could potentially balance their books as there would be fewer people they would have to support.  It appears rumors might well be true and the Crap has begun to hit the fan. Apparently, In a twist of irony, the govt of Wuhan (where covid started) announced that they would have to make cuts to people's medical benefits (I.E. their equivalent of Medicare) and it has sparked mass protests outside govt buildings. See link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buBqcRgFReo&feature=youtu.be]

So How does that affect us, traders and investors?

1.  Media outlets have not yet picked up on this development and financial networks and analysts are too busy trying to ‚Äútalk up‚Äù China stocks.

2. If this is truly happening and cuts are being made then that shortfall in coverage will have to be made up somewhere and it won't come from the elderly or gov‚Äôt.

3. The shortfall in coverage will be made up from the younger generation now having to take their earnings and support their elderly parents and grandparents.

4. That means all those young people working will not be consuming and adding to the economy and that will spell trouble for the likes to BABA, NIO, PDD, EEM, ASHR just to name a few.

5. Chinese are very protective and respectful of their elders and they will not be able to watch their elders suffer so they will have to pony up the cash to support them.

6. The hospital system in China is a ‚Äúcash‚Äù system you either have the funds or you don‚Äôt, the ‚Äúhealth insurance system‚Äù exists but it doesn‚Äôt even factor in that‚Äôs how small it is. If you don‚Äôt have the cash to pay for your needs you go to the back of the line even if your hand is severed from your wrist (which I have seen in person). This means when these elderly go to the hospital and they are short on funds there is only one other source they can rely on and it will be young family.

7. There likely won‚Äôt be any real heavy coverage on this subject as the China govt will not want to lose face but the point I am making is at a certain point the consumption the west is expecting from the young workers WILL NOT be there as they will be pre-occupied with keeping their mom and dad alive.

8. On a personal experience with an emergency health issue in China, back in 2005 I had appendicitis and an appendix that was about to burst, I went to the hospital and they took me in but as I am in the emergency room the admin ppl are swiping all my credit cards running back and forth from the examination room to the cashier making me sign all the receipts, all while I‚Äôm being examined to make sure I was paid up before they sent me up to the operating room. 

9. I am not talking down on the system in China it's just the way the system works, sometimes good sometimes bad. Good being when I first sprained my ankle in China I thought my X-ray would cost a fortune (like in the U.S.) and it only cost $5 USD I was pleasantly surprised.

10. Watch out this could catch the markets off guard, I was early in reporting the Pfizer news earlier this year keep your eye open and get ready there might be a big rug pull at some point.",Coconutisagiantnut1,77,1676516840.0

11n9r7u,I sold my 0dte spy puts too early today and I need to tell someone,"Hi, I'd like to apply to be the head dummy around these parts...For context I swung spy calls overnight (like a buffoon but it worked out) and sold them at open at the high. I felt like a king. Immediately following after, I dumped my winnings into spy puts because why stop gambling at 10 am when the market closes at 430? So I did just that. Dumped around 600 bucks into 398 poots (I know I'm not super baller like some of these idiots in this sub)

I had a rule though.... I told myself that once I hit a certain profit, I will sell half and then at another level sell the other half. I **know** 0dte contracts on spy wither away as fast as you can say ""my wife's boyfriend"". Spy dropped quick enough for me to see some profits and gaze at my phone while my boss asked when is this big project done. He could kick rocks for all I cared. I made his monthly pay in 20 minutes on my phone. Eventually spy dropped more for me to sell all my puts. I felt great I liked the price I sold at. Spy hit a reversal heading back up and I felt like I played the Wall St. Cucks in NYC. 

After showboating for a mere 10 minutes, Spy dropped......and dropped....and kept....on.....dropping. I was shocked. I was terrified to look at what my 398 puts were at. I sold at $1.00 a contract (100 dollars each for the idiots). And these contracts hit $7.00 each. I wanted to cry just thinking about it. With tears in my eyes I pulled out my calculator and did the math. It was disgusting what I missed out on. My measly $2400 cash in my Robinhood didn't compare to the $11,000 (or so) missed profit. 

I felt like I just got punished for listening to myself and following my rules. Why couldn't I have just let them *rideeee* out. 

Anyway I was so furious the entire day and just had to write this out. I may just take the remaining money and spend it on something that won't stab me in the ^(fukin) heart like these puts did to my soul. Just kidding, I dumped half my equity into Aapl calls for tomorrow. I literally cannot wait for them to expire worthless so I can quit trading.

So what does this mean? 

I see two real scenarios that are about to happen in the markets‚Ä¶ 

First scenario is that SPY is going to drop into CPI (next Tuesday the 14th) most likely targeting 390 support test -> CPI comes in good (better than expected) -> market absolutely rallies into FOMC. (most probable).

The second scenario is that markets realize they over reacted and we base/ hold 400+ into CPI -> CPI beats -> rally into FOMC. 

I am bullish on CPI and I think that it is going to show that a 50bps is not warranted yet. I believe what is happening is that the market is setting us up for a MASSIVE green CPI day. I am still waiting for official CPI consensus but as of now it looks really good for a beat (bullish). That CPI beat is going to dump the probability of a 50bps a lot and we are going to see a massive rally.   
 

FOMC when they confirm 25bps will be well received, however, the dot plot coming out is going to be nasty and markets much like December are going to dump heavily.

As you can see we still have a DOOZY of data the rest of the week‚Ä¶ I expect some 1% +/- opens over the next few days depending on what data does‚Ä¶ going to be a real volatile week as we head into CPI next week. 

**SPY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Today played out absolutely beautifully. We have that perfect evening doji star pattern that as I suspected would establish a new supply at 405.2. We not have a new supply put in short of the previous supplies (resistance) at 414-417. With this new resistance/ supply put in here we should look to take out lower supply at 396.46 before we push higher.

As I said before we do not want to leave a supply down below before we push higher. 

IF this sell off continues tomorrow if we reach that 394.7 to 396.5 range tomorrow we are going to come into some pretty hefty support. However, if we happen to lose 394.7 demand (support) tomorrow or really any day this week) then that would 100% set us up for a push lower back to 388.52 demand (support) that I was targeting before last weeks $12 rally. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mpbfs6uhzdma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ba559e8f9d737ba99d1743e4919ed9c10a1bd840

Taking a look at SPY daily here you can see we are still in this bigger blue breakout triangle here. With this new supply (resistance) being established today it perfectly correlates with our 405.3 channel resistance that has been a long standing pivot level on SPY. 

I frustratingly but conservatively did not take that 31dte put swing overnight. However, the risk of this going the other way today was there. 

Taking a look at the daily here the biggest thing to note is that we have no closed back below the daily 8, 20, 50 and 200ema. The last support remains at the 100ema which is hovering just over that 396.4 supply I mentioned before that was a target. The 100ema sits at 397 for tomorrow. 

Tomorrow we have data before market open and we have JOLTS at 10am (data) when JPOW once again will start testifying to congress. There is a lot of unknown. On one hand what possibly could jpow say tomorrow or be asked tomorrow that could actually reverse this or make it sell of further? Not much in my opinion. 

The biggest bear case is that the markets have not (with only one day) fully priced in a 50bps hike. So some more downside should be warranted. The other oddity is that for how reactive SPY was to that drop today the VIX was very underwhelming. Which shows people don‚Äôt fully believe it yet‚Ä¶ 

I think as the data comes in this week with more big data Thursday and Friday we will have a very volatile EOW. I don‚Äôt think going long here is worth it for puts or calls. I do favor 390 before we retest 405 again, however, with so much data and JPOW anyone predicting this is just guessing.   
 

I still remain under the consensus that regardless of what happens before CPI‚Ä¶ that CPI print (unless consensus comes in hot af compared to Bloomberg/ Cleveland fed) will be very bullish and when markets (algos) see that the CPI DID come down and that its IS lowering compared to last CPI/ CORE YoY that the chances of a 50bps hike are gonna dump for whatever they are at back to non-existent. 

While there is always a chance that JPOW drops a 50bps bomb on the market‚Ä¶ in all reality the chances of it is very slim. While inflation is not going to go straight to 2% easily and it will rebound (meaning YoY will come in OVER previous YoY) but I do not think it is going to be this CPI print as of now. 

However, when the FOMC meetings DOT PLOT comes out on March 22nd that is going to be very spicy‚Ä¶

SPY Levels:

Supply- 405.17 -> 396.46 -> 383.82  
 Demand- 394.68 -> 388.52  
 Daily Support- 398.2 -> 396.4 -> 394.6 -> 392.6  
 Daily Resistance- 399.6 -> 401.5 -> 404.5

Futures had a beautiful pattern today too with supply/ demand playing out perfectly. As I had mentioned we were looking for that 4055 new supply (resistance) to be established and we officially got that today. Not only that though we came down perfectly to take out previous 4015 and 3991 supplies from the last 2 weeks. 

With 3991 and 4015 out of the weigh this opens up a push lower to 3960 and 3920 demand. My ultimate target for downside remains 3920. However, if we get a bounce tomorrow and markets decide to rally into CPI then I would be looking for 4096.

Taking a look at the daily chart here on futures we are just chopping inside of this red channel that stretches from 3920 to 4095. 

With a breakdown last week to 3925 -> recovery to 4082 yesterday -> pattern would suggest a breakdown to minimally 3920. This would be a classic 123 rollercoaster as I have talked about so many times. 

Futures today unlike spy closed below its daily 8, 20, 50, 100 and 200ema. However, it is currently sitting directly on the 100ema. We did bounce direction off the support from Friday at 3983 today too. There is always a scenario where we get a massive double bottom after a drop like this. 

If we were to backtest resistance my targets would be 4020 and 4055. 

Futures levels:

Supply- 4054 -> 4160  
 Demand- 3960 -> 3920  
 Daily support- 3990 -> 3983 -> 3955 -> 3945 -> 3920  
 Daily resistance- 4020 -> 4053

Overall despite today being a highly volatile fed day and that massive $4 dump instantly at 10am I had a pretty good day trading. 

I unfortunately found myself in one of my level to level calls. I did not know jpow had a pre-released statement or I would have exited my calls before 10am. I did not expect a -$4 candle but it is what it is. Got a terrible fill on my stop loss too.   
   
 

Outside of that was a pretty great day of trading. I did take some long puts (30dte) in the morning and set a 10% stop loss and was a victim of that rogue $2 green candle at 1215pm. I am pretty bitter about that as I went longer dte on purpose and I would have ended up with a nice 15-20% win. It is what it is but that is my only gripe from today. Otherwise shaping up to be a nice week of trading so far!",DaddyDersch,69,1678225179.0

11gdpdq,Desktop Metal: A Ten-Bagger Tesla Story,"**Introduction**

Hey guys, I'm a long time member occasional contributor. Three years ago I [posted](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cpeu8i/petition_to_give_ubetterthanmadoff_a_very_special/) after a special autist posted some incredible DD after the market closed on a Friday about an impending market crash in Argentina. Last August, I [posted](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wlqb4q/desktop_metal_dd_long_term_tenbagger_and/) my first Desktop Metal DD thread on r/wallstreetbets. It's been a pretty tough year for the stock market and unprofitable tech companies like DM have been hammered hard. However, things are beginning to look much better for DM. Before I get into my DD, here's some background on the company:

**Background**

Desktop Metal went public via SPAC in 2021. They produce a revolutionary line of incredibly fast 3D printers that can compete with traditional casting on a price per part basis. They hold over 650 patents and can print in over 250 different materials. Their flagship product is the [Production System](https://www.desktopmetal.com/products/production) which began to ship. Designed for mass production of end use metal parts, it is over 100x faster than traditional 3D printing technologies putting it leaps ahead of its competition. Their product offering also includes the [Shop System](https://www.desktopmetal.com/products/shop) for mid-volume production, the [Studio System](https://www.desktopmetal.com/products/studio) for prototyping, Fiber for the 3D printing of a variety of carbon fibers, their new unit [Desktop Health](https://www.desktophealth.com/) for a variety of uses including dental, bone regeneration, soft tissue fabrication, and organ 3D printing. Recently, Desktop Metal released the Einstein Pro XL, an affordable production-grade 3D printer for dental labs and other medical professionals. You can read the press release [here](https://ir.desktopmetal.com/news/press-releases/detail/139/desktop-health-announces-global-availability-of-einstein). Recently revenue growth has been largely driven by the expansion of their healthcare unit. Photopolymers are a great addition to DM's portfolio and represent a $200B market opportunity. 

In the last two years, they've made several important acquisitions with the $500mm they recieved as a result of going public via SPAC. In August 2021, they acquired their largest competitor, ExOne for $561mm in a mixed stock/cash deal. Desktop Metal has been incredible aggressive, spending over $800mm to buy out their competitors and adding new materials to their portfolio. They have 950+ issued patents and pending applications for their machines and materials. Their Studio System sells for roughly $300k and generates $1.1mm in lifetime revenue with 600k being profit. This is driven by the high profit margins on their materials. I believe that their materials portfolio represents the key to Desktop Metals long term growth and profitability.

As a result of these acquisitions, Desktop Metal grew rapidly. There were many redundancies that were eating into EBITDA and driving continued losses. Last year, Desktop Metal announced a $50mm cost cutting initiative as well as the hiring of a new CFO, Jason Cole, formerly of Analog Devices. On February 6th, [Desktop Metal announced another $50mm in cost cutting measures](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/desktop-metal-boosts-productivity-by-updating-cost-cutting-plans-for-2023-220642/#:~:text=Industrial%203D%20printer%20manufacturer%20Desktop,its%20long%2Dterm%20financial%20objectives.) for a total of $100mm in annual cost reductions. Jason has demonstrated a strong desire to achieve profitability as soon as possible over growth at all costs.

As companies look to shorten and de-risk their supply chains, Desktop Metal provides a compelling product to reduce material waste and cut costs. Their printers are already used by companies like BMW, Lockheed Martin, Stanley Black and Decker, and many more. Their products have additional aerospace, automotive, consumer goods, medical, and military applications. Revenue has grown significantly from $26mm in FY 2019 to $206mm in FY 2022. FY 2023 revenue is projected between $210-260mm due to macro headwinds with breakeven EBITDA being achieved in Q3 or Q4.

**Why DM is Attractive**

Desktop Metals Q4 earnings were fantastic and exactly what investors needed to see. The result of their $100mm cost cutting initiatives are beginning to show through on their income statement. Operating expenses [fell to $37.9mm in Q4 2022, down $3.6mm from Q3](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_78b61139c42c8f258a21fe79e9c13a8a/desktopmetal/db/884/7565/earnings_presentation/DM+4Q-22+Earnings+Presentation+vF.pdf). During the Q&A portion of the call, an analyst asked about what revenue would be required for DM to breakeven next year. The CFO, Jason Cole, stated that DM would breakeven across the whole forcasted revenue range of $210-260mm. This is **huge**. Desktop Metal has been priced for the last year as if it was on the verge of bankrupcy. Until today's 30%+ surge, Desktop Metal was valued less than the market value of their competitor ExOne which they acquired last year for $560mm. The market has been confused with how to value Desktop Metal and this is why I think we have such an incredible opportunity in front of us today. Craig-Hallum analyst Greg Palm [released in a note](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3673587&headline=dm-craighallum-warming-to-desktop-metal-after-new-supply-agreement-1677774515&test2&ref=tipranks) said that he is ""warming up to Desktop Metal"" following ""solid Q4 results"" and that ""momentum seems to be building in several areas of the business."" While he kept his $2 price target and a hold rating, he said this was ""to wait for additional evidence of business trends improvement"" but that ""he believe the stock can work higher from current levels.""

While I was also bullish six months ago in August, my thesis was that the risk/reward profile of bankrupcy to non-bankrupcy was favorable. Yesterday, we got confirmation that Desktop Metal would **NOT** go bankrupt and achieve profitability in FY 2024 -- a full year ahead of schedule. They have $750mm in assets ($360mm in current assets) and $260mm in liabilities per their 10-K released yesterday. This guarantees that they have enough of a runway to reach 2024 where they will achieve full year profitability. Desktop Metal also teased on the earnings call that they will soon be announcing a Master Supply Agreement signed with a major consumer electronics company that per Twitter, is rumored to be Apple. If true, it would mark a major milestone for DM. Despite this, short interest was 21% before yesterdays earnings per [Koyfin](https://app.koyfin.com/snapshot/s/eq-0digtg) -- even higher than it was when I posted in August. You can read their full Q4 2022 earnings report [here](https://ir.desktopmetal.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001558370-23-002567/0001558370-23-002567.pdf) and their press release [here](https://ir.desktopmetal.com/news/press-releases/detail/141/desktop-metal-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022). 


**This Is A Tesla Story**

In late 2019 and early 2020, Tesla demonstrated something very similar to what DM showed in their earnings yesterday -- that they would not be going bankrupt and that they had a viable road to profitability. Just like with DM, people knew that the technology was going to change entire industries and investors didn't want to get left behind even if they had to pay a premium for a piece of the pie. Tesla shares exploded, rising from around $20 per share to a peak of $400 per share last year. I believe that yesterday was a monumental moment for Desktop Metal, and the market seems to agree. As of 3:30PM, shares are up 38% trading around $2.08.


If DM were to generate $0.50 in EPS and trade at **moderate** 20x current P/E, shares would trade at $10 per share for a 400% return from current levels. With >20% EPS growth, DM could achieve EPS of >$1.00 per share by 2030 for a **conservative** share price of $20 for a 900% return. EPS growth of >40% is possible for DM even in challenging macro headwinds. Considering that DM's profit largely comes from their consumables, they will become increasingly profitable with time as their machines sell and customers continue buying DM's expansive material inventory. Other fast growth tech companies like Cloudflare trade at P/E's in the **hundreds** due to their high projected revenue and EPS growth. At it's peak, TSLA traded at 500x forward EPS! If DM traded at even half of Tesla's old forward EPS in 2025, we could see a share price in the hundreds. 


**My Positions**

2000 shares at $2.40

2 $2.50 Jan 2025 call

3 $3.00 Jan 2025 calls

4 $4.00 Jan 2025 calls 

6 $5.00 Jan 2025 calls


**Conclusion**

When Desktop Metal begins to get more press, people are going to pile into the company. It has all the ingredients for a meteoric rise. Transformative new technology, some media hype, and **did I mention that 28% of all shares are short?** There's a potential short squeeze in the cards. Desktop Metal is a no-brainer for ~$2.00 in 2023. While I'm not going to give a price target, I think that Desktop Metal has an insane amount of room to run. Let me know your thoughts!

If you didn't know already, both bing and google released a chatGPT based AI tool for their search engines. Bing's presentation for their AI was very well prepared, while google's was much more rushed, with presentors making mistakes.

The most important moment, however, came when google's AI bot made a factual mistake when asked what the james webb telescope did. It provided three responses, two of which were correct, but one of which was an action done by a DIFFERENT telescope(hubble telescope), which made many investors swap from google to bing(msft), causing huge shifts. This is why this series of events is utterly stupid:

\- chatGPT is a LANGUAGE BASED MODEL, meaning it looks at the LANGUAGE itself. It is designed to respond with something that, LANGUAGE-WISE, makes the most sense, which tends to coincide with it being factually correct. However, this is a mere coincidence.

An example of how the telescope error could have been made Is as follows:

you ask: ""what are things that the james webb telescope is known for""

ChatGPT thought process: Since ""telescope"" is much more common than ""james webb"" as a set of words, it maybe finds more grammatically and language accurate words to respond to ""telescope"" than to ""james webb"" as there is much more data. In responding to ""telescope"" it pulls together some words that happen to be taken from responses to the hubble telescope, probably the most talked about telescope online. It doesn't care/know that it's now talking about a different telescope, the response is grammatically sound, and sounds right under the context.

This simple flaw could have been discovered with maybe 5-10 minutes of research, or some playing around with chatGPT-I myself don't know shit about AI and still predicted this. Instead, investors decided to shift several fucking billion dollars around, only to discover 2 days later that bing's AI literally couldn't get the fucking date right, and was insulting users, finally selling msft.

This sentiment around AI-of mindless buy buy buy and sell sell sell with minimal knowledge on what's actually being bought and sold- reminds me a lot about the dot com bubble, although it isn't necessarily to the dot com bubbles severity YET.",mylizard,73,1676859661.0

11mr3ey,‚ÄòA terrible environment for equities‚Äô: Market veteran predicts the S&P 500 could drop of nearly 25% from current levels.,"The U.S. equity market is flashing warning signs, according to chief market strategist Chris Watling.

Watling, also the chief executive of London-based Longview Economics, expects stocks to fall into a bear market over the next three to six months thanks to lofty valuations driven higher since September last year.

The S&P 500 was trading at 3,985 on Wednesday morning at a price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 20x even as the U.S. central bank attempts to tighten financial conditions.

According to Watling, valuations are now in ‚Äúbubble‚Äù territory and have never been so high except during the dot-com and pandemic-era boom in stock prices.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a market here on a forward P/E ratio of 18 and a half times, which has only really been substantially higher in a bubble,‚Äù Watling told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box Europe.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a terrible environment for equities,‚Äù he added.

https://preview.redd.it/8gxy6modkpma1.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8f71ebb5c431df539c23f45be6330fa23213763c

When asked about a potential fall, Watling said investors should be cautious because if the S&P 500 earnings reverted to its historical mean, the benchmark could decline by 900 points ‚Äì a drop of nearly 25% from current levels.

‚ÄúIf you say that the \[S&P 500\] forward earnings should be 200, and you say that average multiple is 15 times, you get to a number of about 3000,‚Äù Watling said.

While investors may be tempted to stay in the market due to a lack of better options, Watling suggests otherwise.

‚ÄúIf you want to make money, you should be short equities over the three to six-month timeframe,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúYou should be overweight government bonds, should probably have a little bit in cash, and there‚Äôs certain commodities you should be playing, most likely the precious metals.‚Äù

He cautioned, however, that this strategy is very aggressive and unsuitable for the average investor.

Watling advised that investors should make diversified bets and not bet the house on one investment.

1125an6,Inflation 6.2% Consensus. Prediction - preliminary 6.2 to 6.3%,"Hey everyone. Sorry I've been busy trying to gather more data and making some sort of real time inflation predictor, so I was mainly focusing on predicting each component more accurately.

Some interesting issues this month for inflation:

1. Concensus is +0.6% or so NSA MoM. Prelim looks like +0.6% to +0.7%. Downside surprise is possible due to point (5) on Medicare payments -2%.
2. BLS uses new weights for 2023 using 2021 weights. Used cars less. New cars more. Medical services less. Food a bit more. Housing especially lodging much more. Energy less.
3. Manheim Used Cars +2% MoM you might have heard. Manheim has a 2 month lag. We shall see a +2% MoM in April ish.
4. Cars still -0.6%, albeit somewhat less, but will be weighted less.
5. Medicare schedules for physicians are -2% or this January since Congress removed the COVID payment raise. Depending on if doctors will pass this savings immediately remains to be seen.
6. Insulin down due to IRA. Not too much of an impact though, but still minuses inflation.
7. Hospital Services +2% or so, which partially offsets Physician Services.
8. Motor Fuel / Gas Prices might be up +2.51% in Jan, but Natural Gas is down -2.49% and Electricity down -0.06%. Contrary to popular belief, I believe energy is only up +0.75%.
9. Housing OER +0.66%. Primary Rent +0.8%. Lodging Away from Home seasonality seems to be +3%, which pushes housing +0.7% ish.
10. Food small +0.15%, mainly due to food from home decreasing tinily. Food Away From Home increases a lot, which can have upside momentum to other services.
11. Apparel / Clothing up +1%, and most goods up.
12. Health Insurance less weight but still -4% MoM.

In general, I'm expecting somewhat hotter 6.2 to 6.3%, but not much.

Housing might roll over, which might push inflation within expectations.

Medicare is a wildcard this time round. So maybe inflation might be 6.1% with medicare, but I doubt it, since goods seems to be picking back up, and services looks problematic especially food away from home.",danielhanchen,67,1676381065.0

11e9osd,Charlie Munger is an off-course weather balloon.,"&#x200B;

Article taken from Planet Crypto.

&#x200B;

Chinese authorities have claimed that suspiciously pro-China investor, Charlie Munger, is not a spy but an off-course weather balloon.

Just days after Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, called for the U.S. to copy China in its ban on bitcoin, China denied he was an infiltrator, and insisted that he was another balloon flying in American airspace measuring the weather.

‚ÄúThis is an innocent coincidence‚Äù, said Chinese spokesperson, Li R Big-Fat. ‚ÄúWhat may look to Western eyes like a 121 year-old man in a suit and glasses is nothing more than an old weather balloon ‚Äì or as we call it in China, an old wind-bag. The suit and glasses this weather balloon happens to be wearing are also an innocent coincidence. We can only assume that at some point it must have drifted through a clothesline and picked them up. It must have innocently drifted through an optician‚Äôs too. Does that sound convincing?‚Äù

U.S. authorities trying to work out whether Munger is a Communist spy or an experimental weather balloon have taken him in for analysis but are so far none the wiser. ‚ÄúHe is very interested in the weather, but so are most grandpa‚Äôs‚Äù, said FBI agent, Biff Federales. ‚ÄúHe also carries a little red book, but that turned out to be his bus pass.‚Äù",byteaw,66,1677596320.0

Average open over the last 7 trading days is +/- 0.83%. That‚Äôs pretty dang impressive.. 

Today was probably one of my favor intraday SPY patterns‚Ä¶ the classic 123 rollercoaster.. I have talked about this numerous times but essentially a 123 rollercoaster is 1) the initial move in this case the dump from 401.29 to 398.26‚Ä¶ 2) the recovery in this case that is the pump from 398.26 to 399.51 and then finally 3) the final bigger push past initial low‚Ä¶ in this case that‚Äôs the EOD push to 397.2 area. Its actually really refreshing to see this pattern play out today as this is how SPY used to behave and generally behaves in a healthy market‚Ä¶ these massive V bottoms and Massive LOD to HOD reversals are NOT the normal even though 2022 wants us to believe they are. This is healthy and refreshing to see especially on a bear trend day‚Ä¶

Despite the pretty impressive 0.9% green open and the push over 401 this morning the bears were able to capitalize once again. This honestly reminds me of the last 2 months but in reverse‚Ä¶ how many times did we see major morning dumps and red pre markets only for the bulls by EOD to take it green or at least recover most of the loss? We are seeing the same thing here‚Ä¶ and honestly today is a VERY bearish candle closure‚Ä¶ 

Taking a look at the daily here we had a previous demand level at 400.6 that we came up and attempted to close over today and hard rejected. Generally speaking when we have a demand level like that and we get a massive rejection it is very bearish for the future. Not only that but we kissed the daily 8ema resistance today and hard rejected it with the wick and we hard rejected the daily 200/50ema with the candle body. 

The most bullish thing that we can take away from today is that we bounced off the daily 100ema support once again. However, with the demand level rejection, and daily 8/50/200ema rejection I am going to be looking for a bigger sell off here on SPY this week. My target remains 390.1, however, we do have a previous demand level at 388.66 that we could bounce off. IF we get here and can bounce I will absolutely be looking for a play back to 405.8 demand. 

Current demand levels= 388.66 and 405.81. 

Key SPY Support- 397.7 -> 396.4 -> 395.4 -> 393.6 -> 391.5

Key SPY Resistance- 400 -> 401.7 -> 403.2

The futures candle with this hanging man candle with a beautiful daily 8, 50 and 200ema rejection screams downside to me. However, there IS a double bottom here off 3975. Bears need to break through that level tomorrow and more importantly close under that level. 

I am targeting 3920 support bounce on futures. If we are able to get there then I will 100% be looking for a bounce back to the 4000s. 

Key Futures Support- 3975 -> 3965 -> 3945 -> 3920

Key Futures Resistance- 4000 -> 4020 -> 4032 -> 4055

So Tesla investor day is on Wednesday apparently at 4pm‚Ä¶ I thought about it over the weekend and thought some lotto calls for investor day to let ride would be a great play and well that turns out to be absolutely correct. However that ship has far sailed‚Ä¶ a day too late for sure‚Ä¶ 

Taking a look at tesla here we had that really nice hammer candle doji that also re-established 196.3 as demand on Friday. That led to a pretty massive bounce and yet another gap to the upside. We also have no held the daily 8ema as support and have closed over the 202.1 resistance it fought at all week. 

Our next demand level is 211.5 and that is where I will be keeping an eye on for this week and tomorrow. There is a very real buy the rumor sell the news potential with Tesla this week. 

Demand levels- 196.3 and 211.5

Key Tesla Support- 205.1 -> 202.1 -> 197.8 -> 196.3

Key Tesla Resistance- 207.9 -> 211.6 -> 214.2

The VIX was pretty much all over the place today. Despite the VIX pretty much dropping from opening this morning it did have a bounce off the daily 8ema which at the same time provided a downside opportunity for SPY. The one interesting take here is that SPY did NOT recover despite the VIX continuing its sell off. Watching the VIX continue to unwind while SPY falls is something very important to take note of.

Started the week off really nicely today. I am pretty happy with the day overall and I am even okay with the two losses I took. The first loss was on a potential breakout that ended up with a massive 50cent plus blip down that of course no one could have expected. The second loss I ended up cutting my put early when we broke through a key resistance. It would have ended up coming back to be extremely profitable, however, while I didn‚Äôt watch it the whole time I believe my -10% stop would have hit first. 

I did move up to a -10% stop this week officially and went live with that. So far so good obviously. It is definitely nicer knowing 2 nice wins breaks me even instead of 3 nice wins. However, will continue to evaluate as time goes on. So far so good and positive results there.",DaddyDersch,68,1677533186.0
1197cmp,"Facebook-parent Meta planning more layoffs, to impact thousands: Report","Facebook-parent Meta Platforms is planning a fresh round of job cuts in a reorganization and downsizing effort that could affect thousands of workers, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday.

Meta plans to push some leaders into lower-level roles without direct reports, flattening the layers of management between top boss Mark Zuckerberg and the company's interns, the Washington Post reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.

In November last year, Meta said it had laid off 11,000 employees, a little over a tenth of its global workforce, days after Twitter let go of nearly half its workforce.

The company is also considering more traditional cuts, including slashing some projects and jobs. These efforts, targeted at divisions across the company and worldwide, may not happen on a single day, but will likely roll out in the coming months.

Zuckerberg proclaimed 2023 the ‚Äúyear of efficiency,‚Äù promising investors he would trim middle management and speed up the company‚Äôs decision-making, hinting at the possibility of more cuts.

Will this continue or will we see an upside push? 

One interesting thing to note now is that SPY and Futures are both officially in extreme bear momentum. Which means that we are going to need a bigger and more aggressive bounce in order to see a reversal upside. We would need to close over the daily 20ema and continue upward after that to convinced me of an upside reversal. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4rxy43puh7la1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4168786563e1a067dbad4a60bc58a5c929a16fa

Taking a look at the daily chart here you can see we have that nice 396.36 supply level that we established on Friday. With that being established we then broke out over it‚Ä¶ tested demand and rejected it at 400.6 and then came back down and now we are closing back under supply. This is very bearish in nature. 

I would suspect with this movement especially with the rejection and closure back under the daily 100ema today that we should continue to see a push down until we either establish a new demand or we bounce off 388.66 demand. We interestingly enough still have a very old supply level at 383.81 that has not been taken out yet. We could see a large push or large flash crash there eventually (think CPI or FOMC) to take that out before we go back up. 

Again I remain bearish overall until SPY closes over 400.6 and now until we close and HOLD over 396.36. 

The biggest bullish case here is that we establish a new demand in this 390 to 394 area over the next 2 days and that could set us up for a bigger push back to that 400.6 demand which would get us a daily 8, 20 and 200ema retest. From there though I still would suspect downside unless we are able to hold up there. WE also today turned Fridays 395.4 support level into resistance today which again just further confirms downside. 

I would actually like to be in some 14dte puts on SPY but the issue is that premiums are getting theta ate and chopped up with this high IV and these massive moves up before it finally retraces. 

Supply- 396.36 -> 383.81

Demand- 400.6 -> 388.66

Key SPY Support- 394.7 -> 393.6 -> 391.5 -> 390.1

Key Spy Resistance- 395.5 -> 396.3 -> 397.3 -> 397.8 -> 398.5

I again remain far more bearish on futures than I do on SPY itself. What we have here yet again is a daily 8 and 100ema rejection on Futes. One thing to note here too is that we had established a demand at 3975‚Ä¶ broke over it‚Ä¶ established a new supply the very next day‚Ä¶ and then now we have rejected that supply level and lost/ closed under that demand. Which again as you can imagine is bearish in nature. 

The next bigger demand here to keep an eye on is 3915. Similarly with Spy until we realistically can close and hold a candle over 4020 supply I am not bullish on SPY and with futures also in extreme bear momentum we should look for upside pushes to sell the rip. We of course can play and does appear to be happening everyday the LOD bounces to retest resistance before falling lower. However, the risk to reward is low for such plays. 

Despite almost every day being a tight $3-$4 choppy annoying range‚Ä¶ at some point we are going to get a bigger breakout move and I will not risk being on either side of that. 

Supply- 3988 -> 4020

Demand- 3975 -> 3915

Key Futures Support- 3960 -> 3945 -> 3920 

Key Futures Resistance- 3968 -> 3975 -> 3990

Tesla is sitting in no mans land. I actually almost took some calls on it because of investor day tonight (its going on right now and let me tell you it‚Äôs a snooze fest)‚Ä¶. Speculation remains that a new model will be released here that is about 25k-30k‚Ä¶ lets see if that happens. 

From a technical stand point we are stuck between 194.25/ 196.3 demand and 207.7/214.23 supply. Essentially there is no play until we either establish a new supply below the current 207.7 one which would indicate the ceiling is get lower and we could look for a retest of 194-196 and possibly lower, or we get a new demand above 196.3 which would confirm that $2 range as massive support and that would push us back to that 207-214 range. Until that happens there is zero play. 

Interestingly enough looking at the last tesla investors day it had an 6%+ drop the following day‚Ä¶ 

Supply- 207.7 -> 214.24 -> 224.75  
 Demand- 196.29 -> 194.25

Key Tesla Support- 202.8 -> 201 -> 197.8 -> 196.3 -> 194.3

Key Tesla Resistance- 206.3 -> 207.7 -> 210.8 -> 214.2

Interestingly enough the VIX did not break down today but it did close a red day while SPY also closed a red day which is definitely not the normal way this market works. The VIX held the 20ema support here but did reject the daily 8ema. 

One interesting thing to note is that the last time the VIX was in this area was February 17th‚Ä¶ SPY had a LOD of 404.05 and a HOD of 407.51 that day. Currently with the VIX at the same level our LOD was 393.38 and HOD was 396.69.

What is the main point‚Ä¶ despite ‚Äúfear‚Äù not spiking we are seeing a market retracement.

I just realized I made a ton of trades today. I made 10 intraday trades (also closed 4 different longs) today vs. 6-7 trades/ day that I have been averaging. 

I had opened a slew of 30dte puts on Friday and pretty much Monday immediately regretted it. I thankfully was able to exit all but AMD and Nvidia today for profits but my bags were pretty heavy most of this week. The most frustrating thing was how these stocks would move up and down the way they did. 

Actually the most frustrating and kinda fascinating thing is that despite most of the stocks I was holding have decent drops over night/ intraday they did not gain as much value as I anticipated that they would. My SPY puts were the most frustrating. They closed ITM at about 6% red‚Ä¶ and with the morning opening and a 0.3%+ drop I had only gone from -6% to -3%... I have no idea what was going on with that. I ended up holding until the 2nd drop and then felt like I was winning just being able to exit. 

MSFT was the same was too‚Ä¶ closed down about 10-12% and with a -1% drop I had barely seen breakeven. Didn‚Äôt make a whole lot of sense to me. 

Something else that is funky this whole week is that the intraweek contracts so 3/2 and 3/3 spy options IV is extremely elevated. It goes from 3/3 puts having a 20% IV to the 5dte 3/6 puts having an IV of 15%. I noticed it earlier in the week and we still haven‚Äôt seen IV come down. Its like the week is pricing in a huge movement but its not happening. 

Overall though a good day of trading despite all the chop we had. Really only the bad part of the day was getting burnt in a call around 145pm that appeared to have a nice bounce coming up. Only to break a key demand so I exited early. I jumped into a put for the downside move and ended up getting stopped out on that big 2pm doji candle and then the next candle proceeded to dump. 

Outside of that this has been a pretty good week of trading.",DaddyDersch,67,1677710760.0

I will be very interesting to see how the markets digest these numbers. 

The markets this morning despite lower jobs data and preliminary PCE hot reacted bearishly and then recovered it all‚Ä¶ however, most of that might have been related to the nvidia pump.

The biggest thing to note on the daily here is the fight around the daily 200ema which sits currently at 399.93. Now if you take a look at the candle body resistance from January 23rd and candle body support from January 30th you can see that this 400.6 level that we closed on today is a big pivot level. Back in January when we had our breakout over 390 and 400 this is where we rejected for 3 days in a row, and then back tested support of before we broke out. 

Bulls continuing to defend this level could show some overall strength. 

However we have now closed 3 full candles below the daily 8ema which has not happened since middle of December when we were in the 380s. There is a very clear uptrend break, however, the question still remains of 390 or 405 retest first? 

My thoughts are that IF we get a good PCE beat tomorrow (as in lower than expected) then we COULD see a push back to retest daily 8ema/ 405.3 resistance. If we close below that level that would could be seen as a retest/ rejection and bearish for next week. However, a recovery back over 405.3 would be extremely bullish. 

IF we get HOT PCE and markets digest that negatively we could be looking at a bigger sell off that sticks. A closure under the daily 200ema and potentially off that 100ema near 396.6 that we bounced off today would be very bearish going forward. Now that we put in a green day here the chances of further sell off is greater. 

Key SPY Support- 400.6 -> 398.5 -> 396.6

Key SPY Resistance- 401.5 -> 403.2 -> 405.3

Taking a look at futures daily here we actually have not taken back the daily 200ema and remain currently under neath that which sits at 4018. 

The biggest thing to note here is that futures lost that key 4030 pivot level on Tuesday and now have failed 2 days in a row to break through and hold over that level. As long as bears hold us under 4030 the downside is greater than the upside in my opinion. 

The biggest support area is that 3985 which is the daily 100ema though. 

Key Futures support- 4010 -> 3998 -> 3985 -> 3965

Key Futures resistance- 4030 -> 4055 -> 4085

Tesla continues to show impressive strength holding support off 197.1 for the 4th day in a row now‚Ä¶ As long as 197.1 support continues to hold we shouldn‚Äôt expect a bigger sell off‚Ä¶ yet‚Ä¶ The last 5 days now have been pretty much a fight over the daily 8ema back and forth. IT is clear that the upside momentum has slowed, however, it is not quite clear just yet that the overall downside move is coming. 

Tesla is holding a nice 197.1 to 204.8 range and those should be the levels we watch closest for a breakout or breakdown. 

Key Tesla Support- 202.1 -> 197.3 -> 191.8

Key Tesla Resistance- 205 -> 209.2 -> 214.3

The VIX finally came down and have a nice gap fill today. IT did maintain daily 8ema support also. The VIX doesn‚Äôt give us a whole lot of direction here at all. However, holding daily 8ema support should be bullish (as in markets will continue down). However if we break back under 21 tomorrow that push back to 405.3 resistance becomes even more probable.

Not too bad of a day trading today. I got burnt in that 4dte call this morning on a fake breakout pretty much moments before that massive $6 dump started. And honestly based on everything I saw at that moment and my rules I would take that play again. It was a good play just didn‚Äôt work out. 

Only other lost today came from getting burnt on this reversal. Historically speaking despite what SPY and 2022 wants us to believe‚Ä¶ to full on reverse spy like it did today is actually not common and shouldn‚Äôt be expected‚Ä¶ Take a look at Tuesday for example we had 3 or 4 moves throughout the day that looked extremely convincing of a big ole reversal upside that was just a put opportunity. I expected the same today and that 1pm double top rejection that then turned into a massive rip to the upside burnt me in puts. I had a few times I could have exited green but again I really did expect a push back to LOD and probability suggested the same. 

I was happy that I was able to close all of my 30dte (besides AMD/ Nvidia) at the LOD on SPY which was also the LOD on them. The only ticker I would have held longer or wanted to hold longer would have been Google. 

Overall looking at SPY weekly and tech as a whole weeklies (outside of nvidia) there is still a convincing case for downside to continues into the next CPI/ FOMC. However, we also have to take into account that we very well might just end up back in another $10 range from 390 to 400 or 395 to 405.",DaddyDersch,63,1677187709.0

It's definitely risky, as any ""squeeze"" opportunity is, but there are more reasons for this than any stock in a long time.

The most obvious thing, but SI has been the most shorted stock for 2 months in a row, sitting at 72.8% after the most recent update. This type of sustained short interest has just been waiting to get squeezed.

2. Billionaire George Soros is one of the main shorts

I don't really know much about George Soros, but I know that he is one of the most hated people around. No idea if that's fair or not, but any Google search will tell you that this man is very, very disliked. A lot of the rallying could be be trying to squeeze out the billionaire shorts, similar to the momentum for other large recent squeezes. 

3. Reputable Funds have purchased Silvergate Recently

Multiple funds have purchased the stock recently, and while I don't think that has anything to do with the short, I believe it could actually be beneficial. I could see them buying more to join the short squeeze and help their position, which will trigger the shorts to have to buy to cover their positions. This isn't a meme stock, its a $500 million company, I don't see this being some sort of ""rug pull"" scenario.

4. The company is likely undervalued anyway

SI got pummeled this year, largely due to the FTX collapse. While that was definitely a huge issue, other stocks affected by FTX have been able to largely recover, while SI has not yet. This stock was once valued at $164, and while it likely won't get back to those levels without the squeeze, this company is in recovery and has become overvalued. It is partially due to concerns about their involvement with FTX and possible prosecution, but no charges have been brought against them. I strongly believe this is just the market overreacting.

So why would huge companies pour literal tons of their own monetary resources into their stocks instead of significantly hoarding it or at least greatly diversifying? Is it probably a bluff to lull investors into a false sense of ease? Or is it just a roll of their own dice in the short term, with not much concern over the long?

1163o2w,Blackstone‚Äôs $271M Loan on Manhattan Multifamily Portfolio Hits Special Servicing,"https://commercialobserver.com/2023/02/blackstone-cmbs-loan-multifamily-special-servicing/


The $270.3 million commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) loan on Blackstone‚Äôs Manhattan multifamily portfolio has been sent to special servicing, according to a Trepp alert, CRED iQ data and sources familiar with the transfer. 

The loan backs the BX 2019-MMP CMBS deal and is collateralized by 11 multifamily properties totaling 637 units in Chelsea, the Upper East Side and Midtown South. 

The loan was still marked as current as of this month, and ‚Äî according to CRED IQ data‚Äî a specific transfer for the special servicing transfer wasn‚Äôt given in commentary. The loan was, however, put on the servicing watch list in November for tripping its floating-rate debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) trigger. 

As the real estate industry continues to grapple with a series of interest rate spikes, plus a scarcity of debt capital, Blackstone is currently facing a couple of struggles specific to the deal itself and the broader market environment. Specifically, sources said the portfolio currently requires higher capital expenditure than expected while the firm simultaneously faces higher borrowing costs associated with floating-rate debt.

One source said that while Blackstone continues to lean into multifamily overall as a high conviction theme, it doesn‚Äôt believe the best use of its capital is to continue to fund cash-flow shortfalls within this specific multifamily portfolio. 

As such, Blackstone transferred the loan to special servicer Mount Street to allow the firm time to work with its lenders and decide how best to move forward in today‚Äôs bumpy market environment, sources said. 

The 11 property addresses in the portfolio are: The Grove at 250 West 19th Street, 31 East 31st Street, 344 East 63rd Street, 451 East 83rd Street, 309 West 30th Street, 434 West 19th Street, 337 West 30th Street, 345 West 30th Street, 425 East 84th Street, 445 East 83rd Street and 162 East 61st Street. Of the 637 units, 612 are market rate. 

Morgan Stanley originated the CMBS loan in 2019, with South Korean investment firm Mirae Asset Daewoo and PropCap originating a further $93 million of junior and senior mezzanine debt at the time, per data from CRED iQ. The two-year loan came with three one-year extension options, giving a final maturity date of August 2024. The portfolio was 95.8 percent leased at the time of the loan‚Äôs origination. 

Blackstone, together with Fairstead Capital, acquired the portfolio in 2015 from the Caiola family. At the time, the partnership paid $690 million for 24 properties totaling 979 assets, but has since sold 13 of them, totaling 342 units. 

Until a loan resolution is reached, sources said Blackstone is continuing to operate the properties as normal, and the transfer has ‚Äúzero impact‚Äù on the buildings‚Äô management. 

Multifamily is one of Blackstone‚Äôs core investment themes. In October, Kathleen McCarthy, the global co-head of Blackstone Real Estate, said that the asset class, along with warehouses, data centers, lab office spaces and hotels, make up roughly 80 percent of the company‚Äôs real estate portfolio, Yahoo Finance reported. Further, a national housing shortage and inflationary environment have only strengthened the multifamily sector‚Äôs tailwinds and led to strong rent growth.

>TLDR, as interest rates rise and loans mature that need to be refinanced at a higher rates, more loans will go through a technical default even if the investor is making the regular payments. This happens even in strong rent markets in major cities, this cannot be avoided.",MyPeePeeReversed,55,1676788575.0

That's it folks. Data is in, and we're going back to where we were. 



I'm not gonna say indices are going to hit all time lows or even dip 30% but I'm certain in the next 45 days they will fall down at least 10%. 


If we look at indices when ~~crayon eating apes~~ people believed that terminal rate would be near 550 BPS or 600 we had indices around 10-20% lower. And now that's back with certainty. We are a lot closer to it than we were all the way back in December. It's like indices fell throughout 2022 for nothin. It was for a fucking good reason. I mentioned earlier in the year that there was de-globalization therefore inflation would be sticky. And with a shrinking market during QT we would have a great stagflation. I did say that... May have been drunker than I am now... but I did warn you. 


What did the markets do? Run every single fucking stock higher! Like nothing happened! And no QT?! Motherfucker money supply is shrinking, what do you think is gonna happen to asset valuations when there is less moneys? I don't know how much more I can dumb this down. All of you bulls are bagholders. If you realized gains and got lucky, good job. Now stay on the sidelines or short the fuck out of the market because we are only going one way and that's DOWN! 


Fed is reducing balance sheet and will continue to increase interests and so will every other central bank. You think this pump is happening because of ya'lls' bets? Someone is gonna get margin called soon and dominoes will fall. 


I'm not even gonna get into NSC's derailments. Look at the guidance and earnings from railways companies in the last quarter; Same with banks and rest of finance. There isn't anything rosy or peachy. This ship is going down and you're still getting drunk on the deck. Wake up and realize what the hell is going to happen when FOMC ends and you all stare at the screen with your mouths wide open. Guidance will surprise delusional bulls for sure and it'll be too late. Do you think anyone in their right mind will buy calls before FOMC? I fucking dare you. Get some calls before FOMC and post it. Orders from China had slowed down even before the new year. Railways reported decrease in volume before the new year. Money supply has been decreasing and interests have been increasing. 


It's nothing new. JPow always made it clear that they will monitor data and make decisions accordingly. So don't act like nobody told you so. You're all delusional and hyped for no reason. 


This isn't the time to be a bull. Go ahead and reverse me. I've shorted QQQ, SPY, and DIA 10%-15% from January highs into April and July. 


DXY is already up, bonds are trading higher, what do you think is gonna happen to your papers when institutions leave you with your bags. There is a huge disconnect between earnings, outlook and stock prices. 


This is my last warning.

The large asset management company and real estate investor attempted to request an extension from the bondholders for the repayment of the debt. However, the bondholders turned down the request, as per the sources cited in the report on Thursday.

In addition to this, Blackstone's $71 billion unlisted real estate income trust (BREIT) has been struggling as well. On Wednesday, BREIT stated that it had to restrict withdrawals for the fourth month in a row.

[Property values are dropping](https://aliffcapital.com/real-estate-investment-opportunities-and-risks/) in Europe as rising interest rates put off buyers until a clearer picture about how far rates will rise emerges. That‚Äôs led to wide gaps between bids and offers, crimping deal volumes and putting pressure on owners with loans that are maturing. About a third of all loans in commercial-mortgage backed securities maturing in 2023 and 2024 face high refinancing risks, according to a study published by Scope Ratings in January. 

Concerns about how far values could fall are encouraging lenders to push for sales more quickly, while borrowers would prefer more time to seek higher offers for their properties. The drop in prices has so far not led to widespread credit losses, so some creditors are betting that rapid sales can still ensure debt is fully repaid.",haroon_haider,52,1677804144.0

11mzwhs,"In just a few minutes this week, Powell changed everything on market‚Äôs view of interest rates","*  **Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell set out a new paradigm for how the central bank views its policy path, one that apparently will see even higher interest rates for a longer period of time.**
* **Markets now strongly expect a half-point increase in March and the peak, or terminal rate, to hit close to 5.75% before the Fed is finished.**
* **What changed was the January inflation data, plus signs that the labor market remains remarkably strong despite the Fed‚Äôs efforts to slow it down.**

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell‚Äôs prepared speech this week to Congress took just a few minutes, but it changed everything.

In those remarks, the central bank leader set out a new paradigm for how the Fed views its policy path, one that apparently will see even higher interest rates for a longer period of time than previously thought.

The aftermath has forced the market, which long had been looking for the Fed to blink in its inflation fight, to recalibrate its own views to coincide more with policymakers who have been warning about a higher-for-longer approach to interest rates.

‚ÄúWe have clearly had a choreographed chorus of Fed speakers for two weeks that was getting us to that place,‚Äù said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management. ‚ÄúIt took Jay Powell, over the course of a very brief prepared statement and a Q&A, to get those expectations cemented into a higher place.‚Äù

As part of his mandated semiannual testimony on monetary policy, Powell spoke Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee then the day after to the House Financial Services Committee.

Heading into the appearances, markets had been looking for the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage point at its meeting later this month, then perhaps two more moves before stopping, with the end point around 5.25%.

That changed after Powell‚Äôs appearance, during which he cautioned that if inflation data remains strong, he expects rates to go ‚Äúhigher than previously anticipated‚Äù and possibly at a faster pace than a quarter point at a time.

Markets now strongly expect a half-point increase in March and the peak, or terminal rate, to hit close to 5.75% before the Fed is finished.

11l0op9,0DTE options could turn 5% intraday market decline into 25% rout -JPMorgan,"Trading in new near-dated U.S. options contracts can supercharge volatility in U.S. stocks, potentially leading to tremendous intraday declines, analysts at JPMorgan said. 

The U.S. equity options market has seen a rise in the trading of options contracts set to expire at the end of the trading day - dubbed 0DTE (zero day to expiry) options - with their daily notional value rising to about **$1 trillion**, according to JPMorgan data. 

 Their **recent growth** has been eyed as one cause of intraday volatility, with JPMorgan's Marko Kolanovic last month warning they could spark a massive volatility event under certain circumstances. 

 In a Monday note, the bank‚Äôs analysts attempted to further quantify the derivatives‚Äô potential impact, estimating that in an extremely dire scenario, 0DTE options could turn an intraday 5% drop in the S&P 500 **(.SPX)** into a 25% rout - a magnitude of decline not seen since the Black Monday crash of 1987, when the index fell 20.5%. 

Such a scenario could occur if the S&P 500 fell 5% in five minutes, triggering $30.5 billion in 0DTE option-related trading that would tack another 20 percentage points onto the index's decline, the bank‚Äôs analysts said.

If the S&P 500 fell between 1% and 5% in five minutes, it could lead to an unwinding of positions in the range of $6.6 billion to $14.2 billion, translating to an additional 4 to 8.1 percentage points of decline, JP Morgan's analysts said.

 ""The estimated market impacts from unwinding of 0D option exceed the original market shocks in all scenarios, highlighting the reflexive nature of the 0D options and their potential risk posed to market stability,"" JPM analysts Peng Cheng and Emma Wu wrote in a note.

Furthermore, JPM noted that retail traders were not the main driver of volume growth in 0DTE options, with individual investors accounting for about 20% of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust **(SPY.P)** options volume and only around 5% of the S&P 500 same-day options.

Main takeaways:

1. Disinflationary trends have partially reversed in the recent months.
2. PCE Core services ex housing shows no disinflation at all.
3. Rents will show disinflation in the following months.
4. Stronger than expected economic data most likely will cause higher than expected rates.
5. Continued goal to reaching 2% inflation (not 3% due to some whispers)

Full text:

Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and other members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report.

My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation is causing significant hardship, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Over the past year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy. We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do. Our policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all.

I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.

Current Economic Situation and Outlook The data from January on employment, consumer spending, manufacturing production, and `inflation have partly reversed the softening trends that we had seen in the data just a month ago`. Some of this reversal likely reflects the unseasonably warm weather in January in much of the country. Still, the breadth of the reversal along with revisions to the previous quarter suggests that `inflationary pressures are running higher than expected at the time of our previous Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.`

From a broader perspective, inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year but remains well above the FOMC's longer-run objective of 2 percent. The 12-month change in total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices has slowed from its peak of 7 percent in June to 5.4 percent in January as energy prices have declined and supply chain bottlenecks have eased.

Over the past 12 months, core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, was 4.7 percent. As supply chain bottlenecks have eased and tighter policy has restrained demand, inflation in the core goods sector has fallen. `And while housing services inflation remains too high, the flattening out in rents evident in recently signed leases points to a deceleration in this component of inflation over the year ahead.`

That said, there is `little sign of disinflation thus far in the category of core services excluding housing`, which accounts for more than half of core consumer expenditures. To restore price stability, we will need to see lower inflation in this sector, and there will very likely be some softening in labor market conditions. Although nominal wage gains have slowed somewhat in recent months, they remain above what is consistent with 2 percent inflation and current trends in productivity. Strong wage growth is good for workers but only if it is not eroded by inflation.

Turning to growth, the U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real gross domestic product rising at a below-trend pace of 0.9 percent. Although consumer spending appears to be expanding at a solid pace this quarter, other recent indicators point to subdued growth of spending and production. Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.

Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight. The unemployment rate was 3.4 percent in January, its lowest level since 1969. Job gains remained very strong in January, while the supply of labor has continued to lag.1 As of the end of December, there were 1.9 job openings for each unemployed individual, close to the all-time peak recorded last March, while unemployment insurance claims have remained near historical lows.

Monetary Policy With inflation well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent and with the labor market remaining extremely tight, the FOMC has continued to tighten the stance of monetary policy, raising interest rates by 4-1/2 percentage points over the past year. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.2

We are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, the Committee slowed the pace of interest rate increases over its past two meetings. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.

`Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy. As I mentioned, the latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated.` If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes. Restoring price stability will likely require that we maintain a restrictive stance of monetary policy for some time.

Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done.

To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.

Thank you. I am happy to take your questions.

11d38vl,Tipping point of a bull market or the next collapse?,"We have had a massive rally this past 3 months, with spy being up almost +10% on feb peak since the start of the year, and the nasdaq being up almost 20% in that time period. Both of these have fallen about 5-6% since those peaks, with last weak spy being down 2.3% and nasdaq being 3.1% down. Most of these drops have been triggered by bad inflation reports, but without bad inflation coming out what will crash the market? Last Friday PCE came in HOT HOT, having grown 0.6%, and being 5.4% year over year, normally the market would have crashed 2%+ from this, but we only closed 1 percent down showing that the market is unwilling to crash. Further more the growth that we have had this year was mostly retail investors, and they are not showing any signs of stopping. We have crossed the support that held down the October bottom and the December lows, but that was pre market and we actually almost recovered and went above it again on Friday.

&#x200B;

Personally I think that the March low won't be going below 390-385, and it will quickly bounce up to that support that we broke on Friday. I think that next week is gonna be green with a potential bounce to 405 to 410, and then we will stay mostly flat until CPI. When CPI comes out we will plummet to those 390-385 levels but when FOMC happens they will do 25 bps hike which will send the market to the moon (420+ levels). Even if we stay flat next week (Which could very well happen) I will believe that we will bounce to 405-410 before CPI. 

Will see another October type low? Probably but it will probably be in L  ate Summer/Fall, while in the spring we will see smaller type bounces like we are seeing right now and like we saw in December.

110gqmz,Is there a lithium bubble?,"With lithium prices soaring, I wonder if there is a lithium bubble and therefore a massive overvaluation of lithium miners (like Albemarle Corporation). In particular, miners with only prospective operations (such as Lithium Americas Corporation) appear to be overvalued.

There seems to be widespread agreement that EVs running on lithium-based batteries are the future. As a result, a massive increase in global demand for lithium is predicted. 

Is lithium really a ""scarce"" material? Not really, it is actually quite abundant. The world's proven reserves are estimated at around 22 million tonnes. They are mainly located in Chile, Australia, Argentina, China and the US. It's the extraction that's costly today. Exploding prices will lead to more investment in mining and thus increase supply. Today, lithium mines are being planned all over the world. 

At the same time, alternatives such as [CATL's sodium-based batteries](https://medium.com/predict/catls-new-battery-will-cause-an-ev-revolution-f5ef3fd78dfd) are being developed, questioning the future need to use difficult to mine and refine materials such as lithium.

I find it quite questionable that lithium carbonate is trading at around USD 60,000 per tonne today, which is almost 4 times the price of lithium in 2021. 

That's why I'm thinking about building a short position in potential lithium miners such as Lithium Americas Corporation or active miners such as Albemarle Corporation.

The leading cause of the 2006 housing bubble was 3 year teaser rates for single family ARM loans. When the fixed period expired, borrowers couldn't pay the floating rate. The leading cause of this bubble popping will be Commerical Real Estate, not single family. Single family has low supply, low % of ARMs, and most borrowers fixed for 30 years at record low rates. 

On the other hand, the so called ""Professionals"" got greedy. The narrative of ""interests rates will be low forever"" permeated the industry all the way up to Summer 2022. Most institutional buyers, funds, and developers use floating debt. In 2019 this figure was at nearly 35%.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/rising-interest-rates-hit-landlords-who-cant-afford-hedging-costs-11673900169

The catch is they typically buy a rate cap to hedge against rising interest rates. This is typically 2 to 3 years in duration, and then they either have to buy another rate cap, which has risen 10x at least in price, they have to refinance (which they can't meet DSCR at higher rates), or they have to sell into a weak market.

Office AND Multifamily will lead the pack in losses for different reasons.

**Office**

Office owners are currently in a stalemate with investors and lenders. No one wants to blink first. The banks are pushing back to office narrative because they are the bagholders, office lending was the bread and butter for them for the last decade, especially for smaller regional banks. The few office sales that have occurred at down anywhere from 20% to 50%, often from values as long ago as 2014.

For office owners, the pain is three fold. 

1.) Leases - companies continue to shrink their footprint as leases expire. Roughly 900 million square feet of office leases expire by 2025.

2.) Values - No one truly knows how far these have fallen since sales volume has been so muted. The range has the potential to be massive, anywhere from 20% to 50% loss in pre-covid values.

3.) Debt - In 2023 alone roughly $50 billion is coming due, and this will accelerate through 2025. 
https://www.barrons.com/articles/nyc-real-estate-market-a52c10cd

**Multifamily**

Multifamily has better fundamentals than Office, but greed was rampant during 2020 to H1 2022. 

**Issue #1 - Value add deals (1960s to 1980s vintage)**

These were purchased primarily at low to mid 3% cap rates (6% pre covid).

CPI data shows rents growing at 8% MoM but this data is lagged. Private market data shows rents have been falling since October 2022.

For value add owners, rents are falling or stagnant at best, while facing exorbitant increases in expenses. Older properties require significant deferred maintenance, cap ex, etc. Taxes, insurance, and renovations are up double digits YoY squeezing their bottom lines. These value add deals also primarily used bridge financing with 2 year or 3 year rate caps. Peak sales volume was Q1 2021 to Q2 2022, meaning credit losses will start in early 2024 and accelerate through Q2 2025 as rate caps expire.

**Issue #2 - Class A New Construction**

The biggest lie in real estate is that we have a housing shortage. The truth is we have some self imposed local housing shortages in strict zoning markets such as LA, NYC, SF, etc. For most markets, vacancy is already approaching its long term average, and will soon be higher than historical ranges.

On the other hand, we have the most housing under construction in over 40 years. This will start to deliver Q2 2023 and accelerate through Q3 2024.

Class A rents are already falling, and we have nearly 1M new units delivering over the next 18 months. Historically we average 300k units per year. Developers got flooded with money and did what they do best - build.

Most developers use floating rates or have rate caps as well. These will expire during a difficult lease up environment to compound the issues.

**Timeline**

In 2023 we have ongoing rate hikes, Fed QT $1 trillion per year, and stubborn inflation pushing the Fed to keep going.

To make it worse for the CRE industry, the fundamentals are already weakening before record new supply has even delivered. On top of that, record loan volume will adjust to floating rates as rate caps expire in 2024.

TLDR: Office owners go broke, multifamily buyers during covid may go broke, fuck your near term puts.

112oush,Some thoughts on why the market is holding up,"There are so many confused as to why the stock market isn‚Äôt selling off on hot cpi with a yield curve with the deepest inversion since the early 80‚Äôs. And now fed funds futures and the yield curve are no longer pricing in rate cuts by end of year which so many figured would have been bullish.

Since I haven‚Äôt heard anyone offer up an explanation that makes sense of the current situation, let me offer up my theory of what‚Äôs going on that I‚Äôve held for several weeks now and why stocks are not likely to sell off anytime soon.

It‚Äôs actually fairly simple but requires an explanation. You see most market pundits have this long held view that the bond market ‚Äúknows‚Äù things the stock market doesn‚Äôt and when an inversion hits it‚Äôs a sure fire harbinger of a recession because, well, the bond market is so smart. This ideology is a relic from the past when the bond market *was* smarter, or rather, better informed about liquidity factors that drove the economy. Ie, the fed. In those days most stock market investors were more focused on earnings, the deficit and individual stock stories.

But, the world has changed a lot over the past decade. First, the average investor is far better informed and is fully aware of how fed policy drives liquidity and how that drives markets (and arguably less informed about single stock fundamentals). Mostly this is due to 24/7 real time coverage of everything related to markets and the fed.

Second you have fresh in the memory of everyone how fed policy caused the dot com crash and ensuing recession as well as the GFC. You also had the reverse play out with QE and ZIRP driving the bull market of the past decade and especially throughout 2020-21. The result has been a market that is laser focused on the fed and its impact on the market. Rather than the stock market being ignorant of liquidity drivers, on the contrary it‚Äôs all anyone talks about!

And this brings me to my final factor that has changed and which is probably the most important. The fed has become hyper self aware and terrified of being viewed as making a policy error. Because of that they are very careful to telegraph every move way in advance and now it‚Äôs gotten to the point where they are basically on autopilot, doing whatever fed funds futures predict they will do.

In short, the information advantage the bond market and only very clever investors held in past cycles has completely broken down. The stock market and bond market are in lock step because they are basically looking at the same factors.

So why is the yield curve inverted and what is that telling us?

Nothing, really. You see it‚Äôs precisely because the fed is so ridiculously transparent with its policy plans that the bond market can price in rates based on certain assumptions and adjust as new data comes in.

What are those assumptions? That inflation has peaked, the fed will hike rates to around 5%, a recession will ensue, and the fed will be forced to pivot and cut rates. That has been the bond market‚Äôs position for months and it has basically been all in on it. Why? Because that is what everyone expects to happen when the fed is tightening! The bond market reflects the same idea everyone expecting a sell off in equities has. It‚Äôs really no more complicated than that.

6 months yields rise to reflect rate hikes while investors fearing a recession seek to protect capital and lock in a safe return and so long bonds yielding 4% look pretty great and they are bid and long rates drop. 

THIS DOES NOT MEAN THE BOND MARKET IS PREDICTING A RECESSION. IT MEANS THE BOND MARKET IS REFLECTIVE OF A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT A RECESSION BASED ON CURRENT FED POLICY. THOSE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE BASED ON NEW EVIDENCE.

Something very interesting happened when the January jobs report was released and came in screaming hot a couple of weeks ago. Many people expected this to cause the fed to take notice and hike rates much higher than previously thought. But if that were the case shouldn‚Äôt six month rates shoot up way beyond 5-6%? You would think so, but actually the bond market didn‚Äôt reflect that at all. Instead, short term rates basically yawned, suggesting the bond market wasn‚Äôt expecting any real change to fed policy.

Long bonds on the other hand sold off hard, causing yields to spike higher, lessening the curve inversion. In the days after, those yields continued to climb and climbed more today on the back of this CPI number.

What message can we glean from this? That the bond market is falling out of love with the so called hard landing, serious recession, followed by rate cuts narrative. It seems to me the bond market is in the process of pricing in a soft landing and either a slight recession or none at all.

The fed not needing to pivot and investors selling long bonds reflects an economy that is stronger than expected with recession fears lifting.

TL;DR Everyone thinks inverted curve means recession coming. All it means is there are a lot of people worried about one. Higher moving long rates is indicative of a healthier than expected economy as investors move money out of risk off assets. The process of pricing in a potential soft landing will take time but would look an awful lot like what we have been seeing for the past few weeks since the jobs report was released.",dkrich,45,1676433414.0

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

11fkslv,Tesla new drivetrain will have no rare earth metals - short MP Materials,"TL/DR - EVs currently need rare earth metals, MP materials makes rare earth metals. Thesis is to short $MP

During its investor day today, Tesla announced its new drivetrain will have no rare earth metals. This may not have been headline news, but this is a massive development for the EV industry. 

Little background: EVs, particularly the battery packs, typically require a large amount of rare earth oxides (REOs). Unsurprisingly, REOs are in short supply (‚Äúrare‚Äù), and can be not only costly but a massive bottleneck in the supply chain for EV manufacturers. Not only that, but until a few years ago, nearly all of the REO production was done in China.

Enter MP materials ($MP) the US based ‚Äúsavior‚Äù to the rare earth metal issue. They own the Mountain Pass mine in CA and went public via SPAC in 2020. They ran up and have continued to perform well based on the fact that they‚Äôre essentially the only western miner and producer of REOs. Currently at a $6B market cap, most of the hype around them has been around how they will be the key western supplier of EV materials.

Well, Tesla shifting to non REOs for their drivetrain will not only lower Teslas need for them, but all the other auto OEMs will now be looking to copycat this move to keep costs low. To be clear, EVs are not the only need for rare earth metals, but they were a huge part of the hype and bull case. 

For an already overvalued $6B mining company, Elon just out their entire future in jeopardy if he and the rest of the autos can get off of rare earths.

Disclosure: I am now short $MP

**The lender‚Äôs problems stemmed partly from age-old banking risks such as concentration and matching assets and liabilities**

Silvergate Capital  was in the newfangled business of cryptocurrency banking. But it  ran into some very old banking problems‚Äîwhich could rattle investors in  traditional lenders, too.

The California bank said Wednesday that it intends to wind down and plans to return all deposits. Though Silvergate‚Äôs customers were once cryptocurrency exchanges  such as Coinbase Global and FTX, its core banking activity was actually  quite familiar: holding deposits of ordinary dollars from those  customers and investing in government-backed securities. And therein  lies the concerning part for bank investors.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5lndut5watma1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5a1321c4f8f09d4fd350cebc44db03487a3d43e1

Unlike some bank failures of recent memory, Silvergate didn‚Äôt  have bad assets in the sense of risky loans or complex derivatives. In  fact, its assets were mostly unassailable things like U.S. Treasurys and  agency mortgage-backed securities. But credit risk‚Äîor the risk of not  being paid back‚Äîisn‚Äôt the only kind of risk banks face. Securities such  as these carry interest-rate risk.

So **when rates surged as the Federal Reserve hiked in 2022,  Treasurys and mortgage bonds plunged in price**. Now if a bank is able to hold on to these securities until they mature,  it doesn‚Äôt ultimately lose anything. **The problem comes if a bank needs  to sell them before maturity, crystallizing the losses in their market  value. Silvergate has said it had to sell securities amid its deposit outflows**.

Banks can plan for this risk by aiming to match the duration of  their liabilities, which includes deposits, to their assets. For  example, if a bank is getting funding via a one-year certificate of  deposit, it can buy a Treasury maturing in one year to match. But if a  bank‚Äôs deposits can move at any moment, it has to weigh that risk when  investing.

A bank could just keep all its money in cash. But to earn more,  banks need to take more risk. They can manage this by building up a mix  of deposits that don‚Äôt all move or reprice at once. This is done by  diversifying across customer and account types, or by adding term  deposits such as CDs. Banks also diversify with assets that are floating  rate, like many kinds of corporate loans or credit card loans.

So most banks aren‚Äôt subject to risks of a single industry such  as crypto. Having so much of its funding coming from similar types of  depositors turned out to be one of Silvergate‚Äôs biggest risks. But there  are still echoes across banking. For one, the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corp. reports that banks had unrealized losses on securities of about $620 billion as of the fourth quarter. Plus, banks‚Äô deposits are starting to move more quickly,  and against the backdrop of the Fed‚Äôs aggressive rate increases and the  unusual postpandemic economy, it isn‚Äôt clear exactly what their  ultimate velocity will be. Notably, valuable deposits on which banks don‚Äôt pay any interest have been declining.

Banks generally have a number of sources of liquidity and have  diversified over time. Few are at risk of needing to wind down so  quickly. But many may still have to take actions  throttling back on  loan growth or raising more capital if the Fed keeps going and deposits  flee more quickly than anticipated.

This is my opinion, what we're seeing here is an obvious correction to the top-rate function causing YOY multi-linear growth in the S&P 500. COVID-19 has had a clear correlational effect on the stock market, it's undeniable. However, due to the cumulative effect of many down-rate joint stock indexing players‚Äìthink World Bank Group, S&P Global, and other obvious parties‚Äìwe see this clear dip. Due to this effect we should expect a clear uptick in my balls going directly into your mouth.

11o1l5j,Is their any reason why i shouldnt take a bank loan to short banks currently,"So giving the fact that the fractional reserve banking seems to favor shorts giving system failure. Why should i not take the biggest loan i can get from a bank that has high exposure to SVB. Only thing i can see is things turn around but thats pretty much impossible. Even if it was a short term play an say put it in for a week or two an then pull it out an return it in full if all of a sudden good news after good news comes out. But on the flip side keep what i make in the first month in profit an return it back. Or best case the bank i took it from goes under an dont pay it back at all. 
Im sure some people may have done this already so i figure if more keep doing it things will only ramp up.

119on3f,AI DEEZ NUTS,"**Preamble.**

Note: this is a play concerning C3.AI (ticker: AI). Recent NVDA earnings report is used as supporting evidence. I am not suggesting any NVDA positions, only AI positions. 

**Prelude.**

So it‚Äôs no secret that all the NVDA bears got ass blasted by their better-than-feared earnings report. Even I must concede that it was a pretty good report, especially given that their gaming revenues came in at $1.83b compared to analyst expectations of $1.59b, even in this ass gaming market. They even raised guidance \~5% due to further anticipated recovery in the gaming market.

HOWEVER, data center actually missed revenue estimates, coming in at $3.62b vs $3.85b. For the unaware smooth brains, data centers are where the GPUs that process AI training workloads are stored and maintained. This should not have been too surprising as most big tech companies that reported already told you they were cutting back on cloud/data center spend.

**Stay with me, as this brings me to my next point.**

There has been an AI hype trade recently, obviously, and I am call bullshit *now*. There is nothing in that NVDA report to suggest that spending on AI infrastructure is manifestly increasing \*in the near term\* at all. The conference call was filled with straight up hopium. The reality is that most tech companies are scaling back their spend on *new* data center infrastructure due to tougher macro conditions. Most earnings calls have made that clear. Ignore the hype, follow the money. Enterprise spend is slowing.

Therefore, the recent AI hype rally irrational exuberance. Remember, when you buy a stock you are paying for future earnings, not Jensen Huang‚Äôs hopium laced bathwater. All of a sudden a bunch of normies are excited that ChatGPT can give them a pizza recipe and they think AI is the future of everything. AI was not invented in 2023. These companies have been making these investments for decades, and this hype cycle is not materially changing anything as far as I can tell.

Sure, GOOG feels some more pressure to not shit the bed on execution, but most AI related companies like NVDA are just following their long term plans and acting more conservatively if anything, due to tighter monetary conditions and macro headwinds.

**Oh, did you forget that money is literally not free anymore? This brings me to my final point and play.**

The 6M treasury bill is yielding \~5%. Literally a year ago that shit was basically zero. Therefore, the risk/reward on owning stocks that burn money with no earnings grows more regarded by the day. Furthermore, the economy is holding up better than expected and recently inflation has proved to be stickier than expected, so you bet your left ass cheek that rates are going higher

**Enter: C3.AI (ticker symbol AI).**

This is some shit tier company with literally no moat. They make EnTeRpRiSe Ai FoR HiGh VaLuE UsE CaSeS and their website looks like some coked up incel VC‚Äôs wet dream. It IPO‚Äôd in 2020 during peak market insanity for billions of dollars and is still worth billions of dollars.

Did you know that it is possible for a company to not be worth billions of dollars? That shit may have flown in a zero rate / free money environment. It is not gonna fly now. But would you look at that, it is up over 100% YTD because of the aforementioned AI hype trade.

This is where rational market participants can take advantage of irrational exuberance using \~\~defined risk strategies\~\~ regarded options plays.

**The play.**

Look at the 4/21 options chain. The 20 strike poot is trading around 2.5, likely lower tomorrow due to the NVDA sympathy pump. This breaks even at 17.5 and gives you 58 DTE. AI was trading around 10 literally last month!!!!! Therefore, I believe the options market is inadequately pricing in the risk of a severe correction / crash in this ticker.

This is not gonna be a 10 bagger due to high IV, but a 1 bagger at 15 is easily doable and a 3-4 bagger is possible if it makes a new 52w low. I like the risk/reward and I DON‚ÄôT like this low quality AI rally.

Bear case fundamentals: large scale AI adoption actually makes it *harder* for smaller companies to compete, NOT easier. The performance of AI models depends mainly on the quality and amount of the training data. Big tech has a run away advantage here. Everyone is using roughly the same algorithms. Even your whore grandmother is running stochastic gradient descent on her Lenovo Thinkpad these days.

In the words of our lord and savior Jensen Huang, ‚ÄúLarge language models are called large because they are quite large.‚Äù This is the reason DeepMind (GOOG) came up with the best solution to the protein folding problem with AlphaFold2 in decades, which is arguably the most fundamental and high value problem in molecular biochemistry and biophysics. Data sets are more important than algorithms, so big tech will always win this battle. By the way, AlphaFold came out in 2020, AI is not new jfc.

Bull case fundamentals: they get acquired and ber r fuk.

I will leave you with this quote from a machine learning review am reading: ‚ÄúThis is far from the first time we have seen the use of the term artificial intelligence and the grandiose promises that it implies. In fact, the early 1950‚Äôs and 1960‚Äôs as well as the early 1980‚Äôs saw similar AI bubbles (see this interesting summary by Luke Muehlhauser for Open Philanthropy (Muehlhauser, 2016)). These AI bubbles have been followed by what have been dubbed ‚Äò‚ÄòAI Winters‚Äô‚Äô (McDermott et al., 1985).‚Äù

**TL;DR** buy AI 4/21 20p or similar strikes/exps to destroy the AI rally, targeting a 1-2 bagger. Or don‚Äôt I‚Äôm not your fucking mother.

Positions: I will buy 10x of the aforementioned poots tomorrow. They will likely be on discount due to the NVDA sympathy pump.",EvaUnit343,35,1677127240.0

11knpf0,Robinhood Stock Lending Experience,"TLDR: How much can you make? About 0.1%. Not 1% -- 0.1% annually. Almost nothing.

I'm sharing my experience with Robinhood Stock Lending because it was very hard to find information online about how much you can make.

Robinhood states, ""... stocks with low market availability and high demand are more likely to be borrowed.""

I owned about 600 shares of a low volume stock that had a short squeeze in the month of February. It went up about 50% and had 50x more than the average volume on many of those days. Thus, I think the month of February encapsulates what would probably be the best month to loan out my stock.

Throughout February, I owned about $10k to $16k, with all shares loaned out for every day of February.

From February, I earned a whopping $1 and 36 cents (just to be clear). That's approx, conservatively a 0.16% annual rate.

So, this is nothing (at least with the amount of stock I own). And the question becomes, is it worth it for my stock to be loaned out to short sellers who are going to manipulate the stock I believe in and also apply downward price pressure? For me, that's not worth it, and I turned off stock lending.

According to Robinhood, they determine how much you make by ""a rebate rate that is 15% of the weighted average rebate rate we earned by lending that stock to borrowers on that day."" Per my understanding, this means they loaned it out with about 2.4% interest, which makes sense.

But, @ Robinhood, that's way too low. It's our money/property after all. Want us to take the risk that you default (which, check notes, [almost happened](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/27/robinhood-report-meme-stock-gamestop/#:~:text=On%20the%20morning%20of%20January,of%20the%20NSCC's%20rules%20and)) and let stock/vote manipulators bet against our own companies? 15% is too low.Robinhood Stock Lending Experience

111wxfx,Ray Dalio's Economic and Investment Principles (Extremely Long) Ongoing Reference Guide," 

**TLDR:  4 / 3 / 2 / 6 / 12 (see lists below)**

&#x200B;

**Economic Principles 4/3/2**

**Four Big Forces:**

* Productivity 
* The short-term debt cycle
* The long-term debt cycle 
* Politics 

**Three Important Equilibrium's:** 

* Debt growth is in line with income growth that is required to service the debts
* Economic capacity utilization is neither too high nor too low
* Projected returns of equities are above the projected returns of bonds which are above the projected returns of cash by appropriate risk premiums   


**Two Levers:**

* Monetary Policy
* Fiscal Policy

**Six main Factors to Judge a Country‚Äôs Power By**:  


* Innovation, meaning technology, education, and competitiveness
* Economic output
* Share of world trade
* Military strength 
* Financial center strength
* Reserve currency status  


**Economic and market movements are like a perpetual motion machine of interactions of these nine**   


**12** **Investment Principles**   


* The theoretical value equals the present value of future cash flows
* The actual value that it will trade at will equal the total amount of spending (if I calculate the total amount of dollars spent on something) divided by the quantity of goods sold 
* Asset classes will outperform cash over the long term 
* The out performance of asset classes over cash (i.e. beta cannot be very positive for too long
* Assets are priced to discount future expectations. So when inflation, growth, risk premia and discount rates change, asset prices change
* Every investment is a return stream 
* Diversification can reduce risk more than it reduces returns so it improves return-to risk ratio
* Return streams can be either betas or alphas
* The key to good investing is to create good portfolios of good return streams
* Return streams can be risk adjusted to be risk balanced
* The holy grail of investing is finding 15 or more good uncorrelated return streams
* Systematize decision making; rules should be timeless and universal 

**Context/ DD - This is the looooong winded part**

1. We have this broken down in terms of economic principles and investment principles because the markets follow the economy. To understand the market, you must understand the economy; to do that; you must understand the four major forces, three Important equilibrium, and two levers.
2. The economy and the markets are like a perpetual motion machine of the interaction of the above 4/3/2.
3. Over time, things get better in the quality of our personal lives. We look to increase the quality of our living, individually and as a society - This is called productivity.
4. Productivity is the most important thing, but we don't really see it because it evolves over a more extended period.
5. The big things that we see and feel every day are debt cycles. There is a long-term debt cycle and a short-term debt cycle. 
6. By short-term debt cycle, I usually mean the business cycle. 
7. For instance, if the economic activity rate is too low in a recession and there is weakness in the economy, the Central Banks (CBs) produce credit. 
8. Credit is buying power. CBs produce that credit which creates purchasing power for goods, services, and financial assets - And then, the economy picks up, and that cycle typically lasts seven to ten years.
9. As the economy picks up, the demand rises relative to the capacity. As you get later in the cycle, the CBs hit the brakes, raise interest rates, and tighten monetary policy. The unemployment rate is low because there is less slack in the economy. They put the brakes on it by pulling the lever to increase interest rates. They tighten monetary policy, then you have a recession, slow up, which is the cycle.
10. And because credit is buying power, credit produces debt, and debt means the obligation to pay back. 
11. It is crucial to understand that nature is cyclical, first comes the stimulation, then comes the paying back. 
12. When you produce credit, you can spend more than you earn. 
13. And when you pay back, you have to spend less than you earn. 
14. And that is the nature of the cycle. Most of us are aware and acquainted with this cycle. 
15. With that cycle comes market cycles. And this is all that I mean by the short-term debt cycle. 
16. There is also a longer-term debt cycle, which is an accumulation of all those shorter-term debt cycles. 
17. Because everybody wants things to go up, they want their asset prices, the markets, and employment to go up. 
18. For that reason, CBs will stimulate the economy, typically lowering interest rates until interest rates hit zero. 
19. When interest rates hit zero, they can't do that anymore, which brings us to the need to print money and buy financial assets, which we call quantitative easing (QE). And when CBs can't do QE anymore, or there are limitations imposed, we come to the end of the long-term debt cycle. 
20. So now we have covered a short-term debt cycle, a long-term debt cycle, and productivity. 
21. Now, related to all of that is politics. There are Internal politics and external politics. And in that normal cycle, they are related. 
22. For example, in 2008 and 2009, there was a debt cycle, and interest rates hit zero. And that is very similar to 1929 to 1932. There was a debt crisis, and interest rates hit zero. 
23. And in both of those cases, there was a printing of money and buying of financial assets. And this caused those financial asset prices to go up and more economic liquidity. And that particularly benefited those with financial assets and contributed to the wealth and income gap, as did technology. 
24. As a result of that, in the 1930s and also now, politics entered the picture, and the wealth gap is causing populism. A populism of the left and populism of the right has an effect on the markets and an impact on the economy.
25. So we are seeing a situation very similar to the 1930s in which we are seeing a rising power challenging an existing power, which is a geopolitical cycle.
26. When a rising power in the form of China is challenging an existing power in the form of the United States, and if we look at the history and cycles of those periods - There is a cycle of conflict and peace. 
27. Typically, peace happens after war because some dominant country wins the war, and nobody wants to fight the dominant power, which creates an extended period of peace. 
28. And I am not saying we will have a military conflict, although that always exists as a possibility.  
29. These cycles have happened over and over again. 
30. Politics can affect the cycles. For example, the shift in the United States to create a tax cut helps the corporate tax picture and causes stock prices to rise. 
31. Okay, those are all the cycles. Then, we compare it to three equilibriums. 
32. First, debt growth must be in line with the income growth required to service the debt. 
33. If debt growth is faster than the income growth that will service the debt, we will have an adjustment, and I am always doing a Pro-forma. What is the ability to service that debt? This is the first equilibrium. 
34. The second equilibrium is that the economic activity or capacity utilization rate is neither too high nor too low. That means, if you have it pressing up too much or overheating the economy, that will cause a tightening monetary policy and a correction.  
35. If you have it too low so that the economy is depressed, and there‚Äôs a lot of slack, that's going to cause an adjustment to bring it up, so always be watching where we are relative to that because that is a key driver of the cycles. 
36. The third equilibrium is that the projected returns of equities are above the projected returns of bonds above the projected returns of cash by appropriate risk premiums. 
37. In other words, the capital markets produce the circulation of buying power in the form of this credit, and this relationship of the cash to bond yields to stock yields and asset classes determines how money flows through the economy. 
38. And for normal condition (for reasons I won't digress into) is to have cash have a lower return than bonds that have a lower return from equities, having to do with how the system works. 
39. CBs put cash on deposit, and people with better ideas have to make a profit to use that money to create these other levels of economic activity and have higher returns.
40. When that is not the case, the way they tighten it is through the use of two levers. 
41. The two levers are monetary policy and fiscal policy.
42. Monetary policy is how the brakes and gas are put on, and the brakes and the gas being put on become reflected in each of these other items.
43. If debt growth is too high relative to income growth and capacity utilization is high or stretched, CBs will tighten monetary policy. 
44. The tightening of monetary policy will change the projected return of cash relative to bonds and those equities, and those risk premiums will slow the economy down. 
45. And that will drive those cycles, and that's how the economy operates in this perpetual motion. 
46. If you could picture where you are in those cycles and what is happening, you can anticipate what will happen next because it is that perpetual motion machine. 
47. That is the template in a nutshell. You must constantly be thinking, where are we now?
48. Here is some hard data for you:
49. When you look at GDP going back to 1900, and again GDP is productivity, there is a significant inevitable force that happens over a period of time. Even the most significant economic turbulence you know, looks like a bump in that cycle. Productivity is a big force; betting on productivity is a big force.
50. As you get later in the long-term debt cycle, what happens is that productivity begins to slow because there needs to be an investment, and there needs to be other things. When there is activity or prosperity, you get more productivity, a self-reinforcing cycle. 
51. Suppose you examine charts showing productivity over a certain period in developed countries and China. In that case, you will see in varying degrees that productivity will bend over as they are later in their longer-term cycle‚ÄîUS, China, Japan, etc. 
52. Japan is later in that debt cycle, and you see hardly any productivity growth. 
53. That is what productivity looks like- Now, where are we in the short-term debt cycle of the business cycle?
54. See Appendix A & B to see what the cycle looks like
55. What happens from the capital markets (stock market) perspective - as you begin to go to higher levels of operating rate and lower levels of unemployment, CBs begin to tighten, liquidity starts to tighten, and risk premiums begin to rise.
56. As of March of 2019, we were nine years into the cycle, unemployment rates are comparatively low, and there is less slack, so it is no surprise that CB tightens monetary policy. 
57. The CB tightens monetary policy by either raising interest rates or lowering the purchases of the financial assets they buy by expanding the balance sheet. And that is where we were as of q1 2019. 
58. If you look at how markets behave in that part of the cycle, we break cycles into three pieces. The early phase of the cycle, the mid phase of the cycle, and the late phase of the cycle
59. Typically when you are late in the cycle, it coincides with less attractive returns.
60. Interest rates hit their lows and can‚Äôt go lower, so we deal with quantitative easing.
61. If you look at a chart going back to 1900 and examine the debt to GDP ratio to examine how now, it seems like the cycle we went through in the 1930s.
62. In other words, because of the debt crisis and interest rates hitting zero, you had the printing of money, as evidenced by examining the CB balance sheet, the monetary base, and the acceleration of printing money. The same thing happened in the 2008 financial crisis. You can see the debt crisis; you hit zero in interest rates, they are stuck, so they have to print the money, and then we have the reaction. 
63. Very similar to 1932 to 1937, as the economy picked up, in 1937, they started to tighten monetary policy because they were worried the economy was overheating and inflation was going to rise, and they caused a recession. 
64. That was the first time they used the word recession. It was like re-depression, and they used the term recession, which was the 1938 period. 
65. We talked about debt, but there are also unfunded liabilities that we don‚Äôt call debt - which would be pension and health care liabilities. There are a lot of liabilities/promises out there that must be kept.
66. As it relates to both the markets and the economy - we have been in a Golden age of capitalism in the following sense - Profit margins have more than doubled since 2000, meaning that if you didn't have an expansion in profit margin - the stock market would be 40% lower. 
67. Profit margins grew because of several factors such as efficiencies gained with technology, globalization creating a larger market share, and companies reducing union membership, which reduced employee compensation and contributed to the growth of the wealth gap. 
68. The wealth gap or profit gap has been great for companies, but it has not been great for a certain percentage of the population. If you look at the conditions of the bottom 60% percent of the population, and the bottom 60 means the majority, the conditions have been bad. 
69. Since 1980 there has been no real income growth in the United States. In a Fed survey, 40% of all Americans could not raise $400 in the event of an emergency. So there is a gap.
70. The wealth gap is seen by looking at the net worth of the top 1/10th of 1% of the population's net worth, which is almost the same as the bottom 90% combined.
71. As a result, we have populism, populism on the left, and populism on the right. That is a phenomenon that developed countries didn't use to have. Not only is it a political phenomenon but an economic and market phenomenon.
72. Because as we go into the political elections in countries such as the US and throughout Europe, it will be a conflict of capitalism over socialism or the left and the right, and it will become extreme in both cases. 
73. And as these profit margins improved and corporate tax rates have gone down, you also have cheap money used to buy back stock or make mergers which also helps boost stock prices. 
74. Many of these items will not continue. In Q1 of 2019, this model predicted that profit margins would go down, and you were at the best of the corporate tax rates, so that likely won't go much lower.
75. This all means that we are entering a new environment that will not be as conducive to purchasing financial assets by the CB. Simply put, we are going from tailwinds to headwinds. 
76. To give you a flavor of what this political situation is like and the polarity and the entrenchedness - you can look at charts going back to 1900, which show how conservative the republicans are through a survey to examine economically conservative. And as of 2019 - they are more conservative than ever.  
77. You can look at another chart back to 1900 examining how liberal democrats are in policy, and they are also more liberal than ever. 
78. This means both parties have not had greater polarity than we have today. 
79. Suppose you include the votes cast along party lines in each chart. In other words, republicans are sticking with republicans, and democrats are sticking with democrats. In that case, it easily depicts the entrenched conflict we are having in the US. 
80. The political polarity is not just taking place in the US but also in Europe. It was expected that Jeremy Corbyn would remain in power in the UK, which would impact capital flows. 
81. But France elected Macron, and the UK elected Boris Johnson. Boris is center-right, and Macron is socially and economically left. 
82. So we are relatively late in the cycle and entering a period where CBs have less power than they used to ease in conjunction with populism in election cycles. 
83. You can judge the capacity of a country to ease by looking at the level of interest rates relative to zero, the amount of quantitative easing that can take place, and its marginal effects. 
84. For example, in the US - you go from 2.5% to zero, then you are done.
85. But in Europe, there are limitations, caps at 33% of certain types of debt that they can‚Äôt go beyond unless there is some type of agreement politically, which is very difficult to agree on anything. So there is going to be a problem for the European Central Bank ECB to have the ability to stimulate.
86. Japan was somewhat similar when they had slightly negative interest rates, reducing the ability to stimulate. 
87. So that is the lay of the land with markets and the economy with the 4/3/2.
88. Moving on to the rising power challenging the existing power - China will be an important influence in the world we are operating in for the rest of our lifetimes. And China will become an increasing influence in globalization and so on.
89. When you examine the relative output of China and the US and what is likely in terms of equity market cap and share of debt securities outstanding, you will see the strength of these powers. 
90. In other words, the Chinese/Asian markets are becoming more prominent, liquid, and effective. These markets will play an important role, as will the Chinese economy in our environment, not only in the form of trade but also in the form of geopolitical impacts, mainly reflected in technology.
91. If you look at history and what caused countries to succeed and fail, it was mainly driven by technology.
92. When you examine the rise and decline of world reserve currencies, first, to do that, you first have to examine the arc of each of these currencies. 
93. There is the US dollar; before that, you had the British pound, and before that, you had the Dutch Guilder. And as a result of that, you need to understand several things about the economies that made them a reserve currency in the first place. How did they become reserve currencies, and how did they lose their reserve currency status? This means we must watch several factors, statistics, numbers, and indices.
94. So we get down to the six main factors you can judge a country's power by:  

   1. innovation, meaning technology, education, and competitiveness
   2. Economic output
   3. Share of world trade
   4. Military strength 
   5. Financial center strength
   6. Reserve currency status
95. Power is a vague thing, and you can have economic power, you can have military power, and you can have power in different ways. 
96. We will examine these factors over four cases, the Dutch cycle, the British cycle, the US cycle, and the Chinese cycle.
97. In examining these cycles, the first is innovation, meaning technology, education, and competitiveness. Mostly a new technology, like the 5G technology, and the issues pertained to Huawei and other technology companies.
98. If you have the technology, it works both economically and militarily. And in the case of the Dutch, it was the ability to build ships that could go anywhere worldwide. And they took those ships, and because the Europeans were experts in fighting, they always fought with each other - They took the guns, put them on the boats, went out to the rest of the world, and accounted for half of the world trade. 
99. And when they go out there with half of the world trade, they bring their money, the Dutch Guilder, and when they bring the money, it becomes a world reserve currency.
100. To go out into the world, they must have a military to support that. 
101. And so these cycles go on, and if you were to look at a chart to exemplify this with the US being blue and China as red, going back to 1500 and averaging these things, what you would see is the Chinese have typically been number one or number two. 
102. Although the world was a different size, those were all very far away places, compared to the way we live now, where it is all one sort of world. 
103. And this will conclude the economic principles; as of 2017, we were relatively late in the business cycle, metaphorically the 7th inning.
104. There is a relative tightening of the business policy and monetary policy; we have less economic capacity, greater polarity, and a situation where we will have political issues, and those political issues will be market issues.
105. Because as we start to think - will this be a movement to the right or the left - that will impact capital flows.
106. Now we will transition to the list of Investment principles (Appendix C)
107. First is #1. - The theoretical value equals the present value of future cash flows.
108. In other words, every investment is a lump sum payment for a future cash flow. 
109. So when we think about what is something worth, we look at those projected cash flows, and we discount them with an interest rate to arrive at the theoretical value.
110. The actual value that it will trade is listed in Investment Principle #2
111. 2. - The actual value that it will trade at will equal the total amount of spending (if I calculate the total amount of dollars spent on something) divided by the quantity of goods sold.
112. So we should always be looking at how much will be spent, what are the spenders' motivations and determine the quantity. 
113. In short, we estimate the total spending divided by the quantity to estimate the price. 
114. And #3. - Asset classes will outperform cash over the long term.
115. This is required; otherwise, the economy's gears come to a screeching halt. 
116. And #4. - The out performance of asset classes over cash (i.e., beta) cannot be very positive for too long.
117. Because if it were, it would be easy; if it were positive, you would borrow cash, buy the long things and make a lot of money.
118. It comes with big bumps along the way.
119. This brings us to #5. - Assets are priced to discount future expectations. So when inflation, growth, risk premiums, and discount rates.
120. And #6. - Every investment is a return stream.
121. What I mean by that is every day, you can mark it to the market, and you know what it‚Äôs like, so the key is to put together portfolios of return streams so that they balance well.
122. Dalio says that whatever success he has or Bridgewater has experienced has to do with knowing how to deal with their not knowing more than anything they know. This is because what you don‚Äôt know is a lot, and you can reduce your risk a lot more than you will reduce your return by knowing how to diversify well.
123. This is Investment principle #7. - Diversification can reduce risk more than it reduces returns, so it improves return-to risk ratio
124. And then, we need to get to the next one, which deals with understanding that there are two types of return streams #8. Return streams can be either betas or alpha.
125. What I mean by a beta return stream is that there is an intrinsic reason that that asset class will behave in a certain way that you will know. 
126. In other words, if growth rises faster than discounted and interest rates don‚Äôt rise much, you know that stocks will go up.
127. So there is an environmental so you can structure that. 
128. Alpha is a zero-sum game; in other words, for me to produce alpha, I have to outperform and take money away from somebody else. This is zero-sum, like a game of poker. 
129. And again, #9. - The key to good investing is to create good portfolios of good return streams.
130. And to balance them, you have to risk balance them, which is #10. - Return streams can be risk-adjusted to be risk balanced.
131. In other words, somebody might think that if I put 50% of my dollars in stocks and 50% of my dollars in bonds, I am diversified, but that is not true because the volatility of stocks is twice the volatility of bonds. And because of that, you have to risk balance them. 
132. And then #11. - The holy grail of investing is finding 15 or more good uncorrelated return streams
133. And lastly, systematizing decision rules is critical - #12. - Systematize decision-making; rules should be timeless and universal.
134. What I mean by that is - we should write down the criteria for investing, and then we take those criteria and test them through all periods of time and all countries, timeless and universal. 
135. Because if something happened at one time and your process is not working at that time, then it must be that you haven‚Äôt explained the differences.
136. And so, by forcing ourselves to try to make those rules timeless and universal, it becomes the standard that we operate by. So all rules that you operate by should be timeless and universal. 
137. 35:31
138. If we were to pass through some charts, for example going back to 1975, and you would think of this chart as the ‚Äúrolling returns of asset classes,‚Äù you would be able to see that all asset classes have good times and times that are bad. 
139. And on average, they are above zero, but they all have down periods. 
140. And inevitably, what happens is that most investors love the asset classes that did well. The biggest mistake of most investors is that they think the investment that did well is a good investment rather than thinking of it as a more expensive investment.
141. So you can break the drivers of asset class returns into a few categories, which is true for all asset classes - two main things drive it: inflation and growth.
142. \*\*\*Basically, if you tell me that inflation is going to be higher than expected and growth be higher than expected, then I would know what to invest in, \*\*\*higher than discounted. Not sure if he messed up on 37:08 when he said ""higher than expected and higher than discounted.""
143. But if we knew that, we would all know what to invest in.
144. So those become the two main drivers; they can rise or decline.
145. And then, there are discount rates and risk premiums (sometimes written as risk premia). 
146. Discount rates mean the interest rate impacts all asset classes because the interest rate is the discount rate you use to compare the cash flows.
147. \*So if you raise the interest rate that is negative for all asset classes, and then you have, when you strip all that risk premium out, that equals the following.
148. A chart that shows what happened in history in relation to that context.
149. As an example, a chart would show growth assets relative to assets that you would hold if you had a falling growth environment and assets that you would hold if you had a rising growth environment and the same with inflation, and then add what the discount rate is and then also looking at the risk premium which would be the residual of that, and that's what we have an all-weather return. An all-weather return is an optimally diversified portfolio.
150. And if you were to examine the data on diversification, you would see that diversification can substantially improve your risk-to-return ratio. 
151. Turning to a chart that would show the holy grail of investing.
152. The X-axis shows the ""number of assets/alphas in the portfolio"" from 1-20, and Y-axis shows the ""annual portfolio standard deviation.""
153. And if you can do what this chart depicts, you will make a fortune and be very successful, and it is simple but not easy.
154. The concept is that if you can get 5,10,15,20 good uncorrelated investments, you can substantially improve the return to risk ratio.
155. The chart illustrates that diversification is more important than good, even in picking the best investments.
156. Most people think, give me the best investment and let me put all my money in what I think is the best investment, but that is wrong.
157. The goal is to find your best ten uncorrelated investments and put your money in that, and you will do a lot better.
158. So again, if you look at that chart, and the y-axis, the standard deviation, let's call that risk, of 10%, and imagine, I invest in an asset that has 10% return and 10% standard deviation and let's say I put in a second investment that is 60% correlated with that, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and so on, you can see how the risk in your portfolio would significantly be reduced.
159. This means if you have a diversified portfolio of stocks. FYI the average stock is about 60% correlated with average other stocks. You can put in 100 investments; you can put in 1,000 investments - you are not going to materially reduce your risk relative to just putting in 5 - 10, which will reduce your risk by 10 to 15% if you have an uncorrelated return stream. You can get actually get better than uncorrelated because you can have negatively correlated, but let's say I put in an uncorrelated return stream; you would see what the chart would show. For example, you more than cut your risk in half at five uncorrelated return streams. If you go to 15 uncorrelated return streams, you will reduce your risk by nearly 80%.
160. This means you have improved your return to risk ratio by a factor of 5.
161. To recap, you can reduce your risk significantly without reducing your return, which is the key to it.
162. So when I look at this, I think there are two types of assets; what's your strategic asset allocation mix? What is your beta? In other words, what portfolio do you usually have? In my opinion, it should be highly diversified, but along those lines in terms of something like half in growth, half in inflation rising and declining. Then alphas, you have to have a lot of different alpha. In the case of Bridgewater, there are over 100 different types of alphas and about 130 different kinds of markets in terms of trading.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.

11izux2,"SPY Technical Analysis for Monday March 06, 2023 - Market watchers eye 200 Moving Average backtest","# Slower Rise in Service Provider Costs Boosts Investor Spirits

US stocks ended the week on a positive note as speculation about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes dominated investor sentiment. The S&P 500 saw a rally on Friday, breaking a three-week losing streak, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its best day since early February.

Despite a report showing the service sector's resilience, investors remained upbeat, betting that the impact of the Fed's hikes on the economy would be delayed. A measure of prices paid by service providers revealed that costs were rising at a slower rate, which helped buoy traders' spirits.

Although bond yields rose for the week, a Friday rally in treasuries caused the 10-year yield to hover around 3.96%. Meanwhile, the dollar index had its worst week since mid-January, following four weeks of gains.

Investors will be eagerly watching next week's non-farm payrolls report for clues on whether the economy can withstand further rate hikes. This week's data showed continued labor-market resilience in the United States, bolstering the case for the Fed to maintain its tightening policy, which pushed almost every major asset into the red in February.

However, traders were encouraged by Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic's remarks on Thursday that the central bank may pause rate hikes this summer. Although Bostic and his colleagues stressed that their decisions would remain data dependent, traders interpreted his comments as dovish. A Fed report released on Friday emphasized that further rate increases are on the way, but it appears that investors are feeling optimistic regardless.

# Market Risk Alert

At 16:15 ET, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin said that if inflation persists, the central bank may be able to raise interest rates further. This comment came after a statement earlier in the day where Barkin indicated that Fed policymakers anticipate more rate hikes and no rate cuts this year. The Fed has been closely monitoring inflation as it considers its policy options.

At 12:03 ET, a senior European Union official said that the US and EU are working toward an agreement in principle on a free trade agreement-like status. The two sides have been negotiating for some time, and this announcement is a sign of progress. A free trade agreement could have significant economic implications for both the US and the EU.

The Federal Reserve released a statement at 11:03 ET indicating that the labor force participation rate is likely to remain well below its level from before the pandemic. This could have important implications for the economy and policymakers, as a lower participation rate could indicate weaker labor market conditions.

At 09:48 ET, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said that reports about the United Arab Emirates considering leaving OPEC were ""far from the truth."" This came after several media outlets reported that the UAE was considering an exit from the oil-producing group. Meanwhile, the price of WTI crude oil strengthened amid ongoing concerns about global supply and demand dynamics.

The key focus is on how the price reacts around the 200 moving average or resistance zone, which is currently set at 404.05 - 405.86. This will help determine whether there are more sellers or buyers based on volume. In addition, there is the possibility of overshooting the 2022 downturned diagonal resistance at 407.50 - 410.01.

If the market experiences downside, bulls will be on the lookout for potential support at 399.66 - 397.82 while using 401.93 as a pivot. However, if the potential support is lost, bulls' last hope would be at 395.49.

## Expected Move Based on Patterns

*As noted, we are nearing the half measure to the upside.*

#### What is a rectangle pattern?

A rectangle is a technical pattern that occurs in trading when the price of an asset moves between horizontal support and resistance levels. This pattern suggests that there is no clear trend in the market as the price oscillates between these two levels. The rectangle pattern typically ends when there is a breakout, and the price moves beyond the support or resistance level.

Traders have different approaches to trading rectangles. Some traders prefer to trade within the rectangle, buying when the price is near the bottom of the range and selling or shorting when it reaches the top. Other traders prefer to wait for breakouts before taking action. They believe that trading breakouts can result in larger profits because the price tends to move significantly in the direction of the breakout. Ultimately, the approach a trader takes will depend on their individual trading strategy and risk tolerance.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 60% and 78%. (Stats as of 2023-01-31)",hardyrekshin,36,1677729147.0

114h5k9,The latest inflation data makes the fed nervous,"&#x200B;

Last week we received two important inflation figures, the consumer price index and the producer price index, which arrived hot and above the forecasts, and once again raise concerns among investors that the monetary conditions are not tight enough.

&#x200B;

The consumer price index reflected an increase of 6.4% on an annual basis, above the forecast of 6.2%, but this is not the main problem. The core price index rose for the 32nd month in a row (!) and registered an increase of 0.5% on a monthly basis and 5.6% on an annual basis.

&#x200B;

Core inflation is particularly troubling to policy makers, as it is considered more sticky and difficult to lower in market conditions that are not tight, i.e. high interest rates and the reduction of money in the market.

&#x200B;

If we look deeper, it seems that the main contributor to the increase in the index was the housing component, but even without it, the index rose 0.27%, which means that services inflation is still strong and above the rate that the Fed would like to see.

&#x200B;

The markets tried to ignore the data and closed the trading day on which the index was published with gains, but yesterday another figure arrived which weighed on the indices - the producer price index.

&#x200B;

Here, too, the index surprised the market when it registered an increase of 0.7% on a monthly basis, the largest increase since June 2022. The index of demand for services rose 0.4% and continued to be strong. On the positive side, on an annualized basis, the consumer price index continues to fall and has returned to the levels of March 2021.

&#x200B;

One of the main problems from the latest data is that the Fed labeled the housing market as a disinflationary factor, but in practice prices continue to weigh on the price index.

&#x200B;

As long as employment data continues to be strong, and the unemployment rate is near historic lows, the Fed sees this as a sign that the economy is strong and has the green light to continue raising interest rates.

&#x200B;

How is it expressed? Yesterday, in various speeches, Fed members Master and Bullard stated that the latest inflation numbers signal that caution is required and will even give an increase of 50 basis points in the upcoming interest rate decision.

&#x200B;

Government bond yields have returned to rising and now the interest rate futures reflect a target interest rate of 5.25-5.5%, but the chance of an increase of 50 basis points in March remains less than 20%.",remilevo,33,1676630757.0

1106zoo,Wife‚Äôs BF loves this stock so I‚Äôm YOLO on Puts,"I‚Äôm gonna YOLO this put for a few reasons involving crayons that are red and blue.

Wish me luck.  This Peloton Stock (PTON) has made me mad for the last time.  Not only do I have to know that my wife‚Äôs boyfriend rides this thing with his sweaty balls, I have to concede the fact that I pay his subscription service for riding a bike that moves more than my wife had in years.  They are betting the company on subscriptions that are kinda profitable while peddling a bike designed to not be profitable. Meanwhile, we, the monkeys are forced to pay for our wives boyfriends escapade which makes his junk magically flop in the wind.  

Just look at their low support levels and that overbought and overvalued craziness.  A minuscule -1.7 P/E ratio for a company that has less shorts than Sirius Radio (and my wife made me stop buying that subscription for his BMW years ago).  Peloton is fresh out of Kanye songs and Christmas viral feel bad for women marketing scams too!  

Even their CEO seems to know‚Ä¶.You know the guy?  He is the guy who looks like JPow and Pelosi had a baby that has a superpower of crashing companies.  Spotify and Netflix were his victims until 2010. He took their $168 million package and proceeded to suck 1/2 of their profit‚Ä¶like someone we all know????  Yes, my mother.

This dude flat out just told the media, in a way, that‚Ä¶.
-People didn‚Äôt buy our stuff and it‚Äôs not profitable anyway lol.
- We lost money on our equipment and we are going to gain 3x the subscribers to our overrated boyfriend workout machine to smooth brains too far in debt.
-11% negative margin on equipment? YOLO
-8 quarters into negative revenue. And?
-we lost less money than less time but still way worse than expected. Oh well.
-revenue is in direct competition with the average WSB crayon eater.
-this may be a turning point towards bankruptcy since I gots my $168Mil compensation package locked down. 1/3 of revenue? And? 

Look for a few news articles to laugh more.  It‚Äôs bad.

As for the charts?  The support is in the dirt, and every indicator that I can make with hundreds of different crayons before succumbing to the urge for lunch shows this stock dying faster than my wife‚Äôs BF comes over for me to cook him dinner.  

Today, I used blue crayons because I ate all of the red ones and the yellow ones were dinner.
